'''''Meditations''''' ({{Langx|grc-x-koine|Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν|lit=things to one's self|translit=Ta eis heauton}}) is a series of personal writings by [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Roman Emperor]] from AD 161 to 180, recording his private notes to himself and ideas on [[Stoic philosophy]].

Marcus Aurelius wrote the 12 books of the ''Meditations'' in [[Koine Greek]]<ref>Swain, Simon (1996). ''Hellenism and Empire''. Oxford University Press. p. 29. "Close imitation of [[Attic Greek|Attic]] was not required because [[Marcus Aurelius]] wrote in a philosophical context without thought of publication. [[Galen]]'s many writings in what he calls 'the common dialect' are another excellent example of non-atticizing but highly educated Greek."</ref> as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement.<ref>[[Iain King]] suggests the books may also have been written for mental stimulation, as Aurelius was removed from the cultural and intellectual life of Rome for the first time in his life.  Source: [http://www.military-history.org/articles/thinkers-at-war-marcus-aurelius.htm Thinker At War: Marcus Aurelius] published August 2014, accessed November 2014.</ref>  It is possible that large portions of the work were written at [[Sirmium]], where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180. Some of it was written while he was positioned at [[Aquincum]] on campaign in [[Pannonia]], because internal notes reveal that the first book was written when he was campaigning against the [[Quadi]] on the river Granova (modern-day [[Hron]] in [[Slovakia]]) and the second book was written at [[Carnuntum]].

It is unlikely that Marcus Aurelius ever intended the writings to be published. The work has no official title, so "Meditations" is one of several titles commonly assigned to the collection. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs.

== Structure and themes ==

The ''Meditations'' is divided into 12 books that chronicle different periods of Aurelius' life. The passages in each book are not necessarily in chronological order, seeing as they were written as Aurelius' own personal musings. The style of writing that permeates the text is one that is simplified, straightforward, and perhaps reflecting Aurelius' [[Stoicism|Stoic]] perspective.

A central theme to ''Meditations'' is the importance of analyzing one's judgment of self and others and developing a cosmic perspective:<ref>Sellars, John. 23 October 2011. "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/marcus/ Marcus Aurelius]." ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.</ref><blockquote>You have the power to strip away many superfluous troubles located wholly in your judgment, and to possess a large room for yourself embracing in thought the whole cosmos, to consider everlasting time, to think of the rapid change in the parts of each thing, of how short it is from birth until dissolution, and how the void before birth and that after dissolution are equally infinite. </blockquote>Aurelius advocates finding one's place in the universe and sees that everything came from nature, and so everything shall return to it in due time. Another strong theme is of maintaining focus and to be without distraction all the while maintaining strong ethical principles such as "Being a good man."<ref>Roberts, John, ed. 23 October 2011. "[https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192801463.001.0001/acref-9780192801463-e-290?rskey=jNKHnH&result=282 Aurēlius, Marcus]." ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Classical World''.</ref>

His Stoic ideas often involve avoiding indulgence in sensory affections, a skill which will free a man from the pains and pleasures of the material world. He claims that the only way a man can be harmed by others is to allow his reaction to overpower him. An internal orderly and rational nature, or ''[[logos]],'' permeates and guides all existence. [[Rationality]] and [[equanimity|clear-mindedness]] allow one to live in harmony with the ''logos''. This allows one to rise above faulty perceptions of "good" and "bad"—things out of your control like fame and wealth are (unlike things in your control) irrelevant and neither good nor bad.

== Reception ==
Marcus Aurelius has been lauded for his capacity "to write down what was in his heart just as it was, not obscured by any consciousness of the presence of listeners or any striving after effect." [[Gilbert Murray]] compares the work to [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau's]] ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine's]] ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]''. Though Murray criticizes Marcus for the "harshness and plainness of his literary style", he finds in his ''Meditations'' "as much intensity of feeling...as in most of the nobler modern books of religion, only [with] a sterner power controlling it." "People fail to understand Marcus," he writes, "not because of his lack of self-expression, but because it is hard for most men to breathe at that intense height of spiritual life, or, at least, to breathe soberly."<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Gilbert |title=Five Stages of Greek Religion |orig-year=1912 |edition=3rd |year=2002 |publisher=Dover Publications |pages=168–169 |isbn=978-0486425009}}</ref>

Rees (1992) calls the ''Meditations'' "unendingly moving and inspiring," but does not offer them up as works of original philosophy.<ref name="Rees">Rees, D. A. 1992. "Introduction." In ''Meditations'', edited by A. S. L. Farquhrson (1944). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. {{ISBN|978-0679412717}}. p. xvii.</ref> [[Bertrand Russell]] found them contradictory and inconsistent, evidence of a "tired age" where "even real goods lose their savour." Using Marcus as an example of greater [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophy, he found the Stoic ethical philosophy to contain an element of "[[The Fox and the Grapes|sour grapes]]." "We can't be happy, but we can be good; let us therefore pretend that, so long as we are good, it doesn't matter being unhappy."<ref name="Russell 2004 248–56">{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=History of Western Philosophy |orig-year=1946 |year=2004 |pages=248–256 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0415325059}}</ref> Both Russell and Rees find an element of Marcus' Stoic philosophy in the philosophical system of [[Immanuel Kant]].<ref name="Rees"/><ref name="Russell 2004 248–56"/>

In the Introduction to his 1964 translation of ''Meditations'', the Anglican priest [[Maxwell Staniforth]] discussed the profound impact of [[Stoicism]] on [[Christianity]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |author-link=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0 |url-access=registration |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0/page/n63 2]–27 |isbn=978-0140441406 }}</ref> [[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]] called Marcus Aurelius "the noblest of all the men who, by sheer intelligence and force of character, have prized and achieved goodness for its own sake and not for any reward."<ref>{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Michael |title=The Climax of Rome: The Final Achievements of the Ancient World, AD 161–337 |orig-year=1968 |year=1993 |publisher=London: Weidenfeld |page=[https://archive.org/details/climaxofromefina0000gran/page/139 139] |isbn=978-0297813910 |url=https://archive.org/details/climaxofromefina0000gran/page/139 }}</ref> Gregory Hays' translation of ''Meditations'' for [[The Modern Library]] made ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s bestseller list for two weeks in 2002.<ref>The Washington Post Bestseller List June 9th, 2002</ref>

[[Wen Jiabao]], the former Prime Minister of China, has said that he has read the Meditations a hundred times. He also stated that he was "very deeply impressed" by the work.<ref>[https://www.newsweek.com/chinese-prime-minister-wen-jiabao-interviewed-89187 Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao Interviewed], ''Newsweek''</ref>
