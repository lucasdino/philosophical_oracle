"'''Self-Reliance'''" is an 1841 essay written by American [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] philosopher [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. It contains the most thorough statement of one of his recurrent themes: the need for each person to avoid conformity and false consistency, and follow his or her own instincts and ideas. It is the source of one of his most famous quotations:
: "A foolish consistency is the [[hobgoblin]] of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines."<ref>
This essay is an analysis into the nature of the "aboriginal self on which a universal reliance may be grounded".<ref name=Baldwin/> Emerson emphasizes the importance of individualism and its effect on a person's satisfaction in life, explaining how life is "learning and forgetting and learning again".<ref name=Liang-2014-11-Eye-I/>

== History ==
The first hint of the philosophy that would become "Self-Reliance" was presented by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] as part of a sermon in September 1830 a month after his first marriage.<ref name=Richardson-1995-MndFr/>{{rp|p=99|style=ama}} His wife Ellen was sick with [[tuberculosis]]<ref name=McAleer-1984-RWE/> and, as Emerson's biographer Robert D. Richardson wrote, "Immortality had never been stronger or more desperately needed!"<ref name=Richardson-1995-MndFr/>{{rp|p=99|style=ama}}

From 1836 into 1837, Emerson presented a series of lectures on the philosophy of history at Boston's Masonic Temple. These lectures were never published separately, but many of his thoughts in these were later used in "Self-Reliance" and several other essays.<ref name=Richardson-1995-MndFr/>{{rp|style=ama|p=257}} Later lectures, such as "[[The American Scholar]]" and the [[Divinity School Address]],<ref name=Sacks-2003-UndEm/>
by Emerson led to public [[censure]] of his radical views, the staunch defense of [[individualism]] in "Self-Reliance" being a possible reaction to that censure.<ref name=Richardson-1995-MndFr/>{{rp|style=ama|p=300}}

"Self-Reliance" was first published in his 1841 collection, ''Essays: First Series.''<ref name=Myerson-2000-Trnsdsm/>
Emerson helped start the beginning of the [[Transcendentalist movement]] in America. "Self-Reliance" is one of Emerson's most famous essays. Emerson wrote on "individualism, personal responsibility, and nonconformity."<ref name=Hacht-2007-AmDr/>

Emerson had a very large background of religious affiliations. His father was a Unitarian minister; Emerson eventually followed in his father's footsteps to become a minister as well. Emerson's religious practices can be viewed as unconventional and his beliefs, non-traditional. Emerson understood that individuals are inexplicably different and ideas are constantly changing. He encouraged religious individuals to "'breathe new life into the old forms of their religion."<ref name=Zalta-StnEnc-RWEmerson/>

The Transcendentalist movement flourished in New England and proposed a revolutionarily new philosophy of life. This new philosophy drew upon old ideas of Romanticism, Unitarianism, and German Idealism as well as the American republican tradition.<ref name="Malachuk-1998-Republican">{{cite journal |last1=Malachuk |first1=Daniel |title=The Republican Philosophy of Emerson's Early Lectures |journal=New England Quarterly |date=September 1998 |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=404–428 |doi=10.2307/366851 |jstor=366851 |ref=Malachuk-1998-Republican}}</ref> Some of these ideas pertained closely to the values of America at the time. These values included nature, individualism, and reform, and can be noted in Emerson's essay.

== Themes ==
Emerson's themes include the authority of the individual, according to Anne Marie Hacht. Nothing has authority over the self, she says. One particular temptation is to find enlightenment in history but Emerson argues that it can only come from individual searching. He believes that truth is inside a person and this is an authority, not institutions like religion.<ref name=Hacht-2007-AmDr/>

Emerson's essay focuses and consistently relates back to one major theme: "Trust thyself".<ref name=Emerson-1841-2019-Gtbg-16643/>

One of the most prevalent themes in the essay is nonconformity. Emerson states,
: "Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist".<ref name=Hacht-2007-AmDr/>

He counsels his readers to do what they think is right no matter what others think.<ref name=Hacht-2007-AmDr/>

Haijing Liang, in her analysis of "Self-Reliance", explains how Emerson "encourages the readers to free themselves from the constraints of conformity and give themselves back to their nature".<ref name=Liang-2014-11-Eye-I/>

Solitude and the community appear within the essay multiple times. Emerson wrote how the community is a distraction to self-growth, by friendly visits, and family needs. He advocates more time being spent reflecting on one's self. This can also happen in the community through strong self-confidence. This would help the counseled to not sway from his beliefs in groups of people.<ref name=Hacht-2007-AmDr/> Emerson mentions "but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude."<ref name=Emerson-1841-2019-Gtbg-16643/>

[[Spirituality]], specifically the idea that truth is within one's self, is a recurring theme in Emerson's essay. Emerson posits that reliance upon institutionalized religion hinders the ability to grow mentally as an individual.<ref name=Hacht-2007-AmDr/>

The theme of individualism is often proposed within "Self-Reliance".
Emerson explains the ultimate form of happiness is achieved when a person learns and adapts an individualistic lifestyle based on their own values.<ref name=dict-def-individualism/><ref name=Liang-2014-11-Eye-I/>
Emerson emphasizes, "Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles."<ref name=Emerson-1841-2019-Gtbg-16643/>

The conflict between originality and imitation is often an oscillating theme in the essay. Emerson emphasizes that "Envy is ignorance, imitation is suicide."<ref name=Emerson-1841-2019-Gtbg-16643/><ref name=Liang-2014-11-Eye-I/> Near the end, he encourages society: "Insist on yourself; never imitate."<ref name=Emerson-1841-2019-Gtbg-16643/>

== Criticism ==
Herman Melville's 1851 novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''<ref name=Melville-1851-Moby-Dick-1981-Bantham/> has been read as a critique of Emerson's philosophy of self-reliance, embodied particularly in the life and death of [[Captain Ahab|Ahab]]. Melville's critique of self-reliance as a way of life is seen to lie in its destructive potential, especially when taken to extremes. Richard Chase writes that for Melville,
: "Death – spiritual, emotional, physical – is the price of self-reliance when it is pushed to the point of [[solipsism]], where the world has no existence apart from the all-sufficient self."<ref name=Chase-1962-Melville/>

In that regard, Chase sees Melville's art as antithetical to that of Emerson's thought, in that Melville
: "[points] up the dangers of an exaggerated self-regard, rather than, as ... Emerson loved to do, [suggested] the vital possibilities of the self."<ref name=Chase-1962-Melville/>

Newton Arvin further suggests that self-reliance was, for Melville, really the
: "[masquerade in kingly weeds of] a wild egoism, anarchic, irresponsible, and destructive."<ref name=Melville-1851-Moby-Dick-1981-Bantham/>

Although never directly stated, Emerson's "Self-Reliance" has religious influences tied into the values and beliefs presented. Critics argue that Emerson believes the Universe is not complete without "The Spirit". Without some form of spirituality or religious tendencies, society and the universe "is sad, hopeless, and largely meaningless."<ref name=Cladis-2009-03-Relg-Lit/>
In his work, the transcendentalist argues that no person, specifically individuals who are self-reliant, exists without a slight connection to a higher power. Mark Cladis, author of a published religious analysis of "Self-Reliance", argues individuals are
: "intimately connected to that which is greater than the self alone."<ref name=Cladis-2009-03-Relg-Lit/>

Emerson encourages his readers to understand that self-reliance is
: "freedom in a spiritual universe that is just as rule-governed as the Newtonian physical universe".<ref name=Cladis-2009-03-Relg-Lit/>

Cladis explains that individuals are not expected to endure life alone; achieving self-reliance is understanding that
: "we are surrounded by helps and aids of all kinds, supporting us, sustaining us, journeying always with us."<ref name=Cladis-2009-03-Relg-Lit/>

== In popular culture ==
Emerson's quote, "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds", is a [[running joke]] in the 1998 film ''[[Next Stop Wonderland]]''. A single woman (portrayed by [[Hope Davis]]), who is familiar with the Emerson quote, goes on dates with several men, each of whom tries to impress her by referencing the line, but misquotes it and misattributes it to [[W. C. Fields|W.C. Fields]], [[Karl Marx]], or [[Cicero]].<ref name=OSullivan-1998-08-28-WPost/>

This quote is also referenced in one of the episodes of the television show ''[[The Mentalist]]'' when Patrick Jane meets a crime boss and they start a dialogue.
It was also stated in the 1989 film ''[[Dream a Little Dream (film)|Dream a Little Dream]]'' in reference to a group of teenagers who regularly take a short cut through the backyard of an older couple, it is used as well in the 1972 comedy film ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]''

[[Isaac Asimov]], in author's notes to his collection of mystery short stories, ''[[Asimov's Mysteries]]'', invokes the quote with the single word ''"Emerson!"'' whenever one story in the collection, set in a common universe, appears to contradict another. For instance, the story "[[The Dying Night]]" appears to contradict the background of "[[The Singing Bell]]". Asimov relates how he was introduced to the quotation while reviewing proofs of an article with his co-authors.
