      "When I was three days old, the doctors told my parents I was a severe hemophiliac, meaning my blood does not clot. Lucky for me, there was a product just approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It was called Factor VIII, which contains the clotting agent found in blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I was growing up, I had many bleeds or hemorhages in my joints which make it very painful. Twice a week I would receive injections or IV's of Factor VIII which clotted the blood and then broke it down. A bleed occurs from a broken blood vessel or vein. The blood then had nowhere to go so it would swell up in a joint. You could compare it to trying to pour a quart of milk into a pint-sized container of milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first five to six years of my life were spent in and out of the hospital. All in all I led a pretty normal life. Most recently my battle has been against AIDS and the discrimination surrounding it. On December 17, 1984, I had surgery to remove two inches of my left lung due to pneumonia. After two hours of surgery the doctors told my mother I had AIDS. I contracted AIDS through my Factor VIII which is made from blood. When I came out of surgery, I was on a respirator and had a tube in my left lung. I spent Christmas and the next thirty days in the hospital. A lot of my time was spent searching, thinking and planning my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came face to face with death at thirteen years old. I was diagnosed with AIDS: a killer. Doctors told me I'm not contagious. Given six months to live and being the fighter that I am, I set high goals for myself. It was my decision to live a normal life, go to school, be with my friends, and enjoying day to day activities. It was not going to be easy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The school I was going to said they had no guidelines for a person with AIDS. The school board, my teachers, and my principal voted to keep me out of the classroom even after the guidelines were set by the I.S.B.H., for fear of someone getting AIDS from me by casual contact. Rumors of sneezing, kissing, tears, sweat, and saliva spreading AIDS caused people to panic.\n",
      "\n",
      "We began a series of court battles for nine months, while I was attending classes by telephone. Eventually, I won the right to attend school, but the prejudice was still there. Listening to medical facts was not enough. People wanted one hundred percent guarantees. There are no one hundred percent guarantees in life, but concessions were made by Mom and me to help ease the fear. We decided to meet them halfway:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Separate restrooms\n",
      "* No gym\n",
      "* Separate drinking fountains\n",
      "* Disposable eating utensils and trays\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though we knew AIDS was not spread through casual contact. Nevertheless, parents of twenty students started their own school. They were still not convinced. Because of the lack of education on AIDS, discrimination, fear, panic, and lies surrounded me:\n",
      "\n",
      "* I became the target of Ryan White jokes\n",
      "* Lies about me biting people\n",
      "* Spitting on vegetables and cookies\n",
      "* Urinating on bathroom walls\n",
      "* Some restaurants threw away my dishes\n",
      "* My school locker was vandalized inside and folders were marked FAG and other obscenities\n",
      "\n",
      "I was labeled a troublemaker, my mom an unfit mother, and I was not welcome anywhere. People would get up and leave so they would not have to sit anywhere near me. Even at church, people would not shake my hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "This brought on the news media, TV crews, interviews, and numerous public appearances. I became known as the AIDS boy. I received thousands of letters of support from all around the world, all because I wanted to go to school. Mayor Koch, of New York, was the first public figure to give me support. Entertainers, athletes, and stars started giving me support. I met some of the greatest like Elton John, Greg Louganis, Max Headroom, Alyssa Milano (my teen idol), Lyndon King (Los Angeles Raiders), and Charlie Sheen. All of these plus many more became my friends, but I had very few friends at school. How could these people in the public eye not be afraid of me, but my whole town was?\n",
      "\n",
      "It was difficult, at times, to handle; but I tried to ignore the injustice, because I knew the people were wrong. My family and I held no hatred for those people because we realized they were victims of their own ignorance. We had great faith that with patience, understanding, and education, that my family and I could be helpful in changing their minds and attitudes around. Financial hardships were rough on us, even though Mom had a good job at G.M. The more I was sick, the more work she had to miss. Bills became impossible to pay. My sister, Andrea, was a championship roller skater who had to sacrifice too. There was no money for her lessons and travel. AIDS can destroy a family if you let it, but luckily for my sister and me, Mom taught us to keep going. Don't give up, be proud of who you are, and never feel sorry for yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "After two and a half years of declining health, two attacks of pneumocystis, shingles, a rare form of whooping cough, and liver problems, I faced fighting chills, fevers, coughing, tiredness, and vomiting. I was very ill and being tutored at home. The desire to move into a bigger house, to avoid living AIDS daily, and a dream to be accepted by a community and school, became possible and a reality with a movie about my life, The Ryan White Story.\n",
      "\n",
      "My life is better now. At the end of the school year (1986-87), my family and I decided to move to Cicero, Indiana. We did a lot of hoping and praying that the community would welcome us, and they did. For the first time in three years, we feel we have a home, a supportive school, and lots of friends. The communities of Cicero, Atlanta, Arcadia, and Noblesville, Indiana, are now what we call \"home.\" I'm feeling great. I am a normal happy teenager again. I have a learner's permit. I attend sports functions and dances. My studies are important to me. I made the honor roll just recently, with 2 A's and 2 B's. I'm just one of the kids, and all because the students at Hamilton Heights High School listened to the facts, educated their parents and themselves, and believed in me.\n",

      "<h3> 3.1 FROM THE OLD TERRORISM TO THE NEW: THE FIRST WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING</h3>\n",
      "At 18 minutes after noon on February 26, 1993, a huge bomb went off beneath\n",
      "the two towers of the World Trade Center. This was not a suicide attack. The\n",
      "terrorists parked a truck bomb with a timing device on Level B-2 of the underground\n",
      "garage, then departed. The ensuing explosion opened a hole seven stories\n",
      "up. Six people died. More than a thousand were injured. An FBI agent at\n",
      "the scene described the relatively low number of fatalities as a miracle.\n",
      "\n",
      "President  ordered his National Security Council to coordinate\n",
      "the response. Government agencies swung into action to find the culprits. The\n",
      "Counterterrorist Center located at the CIA combed its files and queried\n",
      "sources around the world. The National Security Agency (NSA), the huge\n",
      "Defense Department signals collection agency, ramped up its communications\n",
      "intercept network and searched its databases for clues.\n",
      "The New York Field\n",
      "Office of the FBI took control of the local investigation and, in the end, set a\n",
      "pattern for future management of terrorist incidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four features of this episode have significance for the story of 9/11.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the bombing signaled a new terrorist challenge, one whose rage and\n",
      "malice had no limit. Ramzi Yousef, the Sunni extremist who planted the bomb,\n",
      "said later that he had hoped to kill 250,000 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the FBI and the Justice Department did excellent work investigating\n",
      "the bombing. Within days, the FBI identified a truck remnant as part of a\n",
      "Ryder rental van reported stolen in Jersey City the day before the bombing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mohammed Salameh, who had rented the truck and reported it stolen, kept\n",
      "calling the rental office to get back his $400 deposit. The FBI arrested him there\n",
      "on March 4, 1993. In short order, the Bureau had several plotters in custody,\n",
      "including Nidal Ayyad, an engineer who had acquired chemicals for the bomb,\n",
      "and Mahmoud Abouhalima, who had helped mix the chemicals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FBI identified another conspirator, Ahmad Ajaj, who had been arrested\n",
      "by immigration authorities at John F. Kennedy International Airport in September\n",
      "1992 and charged with document fraud. His traveling companion was\n",
      "Ramzi Yousef, who had also entered with fraudulent documents but claimed\n",
      "political asylum and was admitted. It quickly became clear that Yousef had been\n",
      "a central player in the attack. He had fled to Pakistan immediately after the\n",
      "bombing and would remain at large for nearly two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrests of Salameh, Abouhalima, and Ayyad led the FBI to the Farouq\n",
      "mosque in Brooklyn, where a central figure was Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman,\n",
      "an extremist Sunni Muslim cleric who had moved to the United States from\n",
      "Egypt in 1990. In speeches and writings, the sightless Rahman, often called the\n",
      "“Blind Sheikh,” preached the message of Sayyid Qutb’s Milestones, characterizing\n",
      "the United States as the oppressor of Muslims worldwide and asserting that\n",
      "it was their religious duty to fight against God’s enemies. An FBI informant\n",
      "learned of a plan to bomb major New York landmarks, including the Holland\n",
      "and Lincoln tunnels. Disrupting this “landmarks plot,” the FBI in June 1993\n",
      "arrested Rahman and various confederates.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of the investigations and arrests, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern\n",
      "District of New York prosecuted and convicted multiple individuals,\n",
      "including Ajaj, Salameh, Ayyad, Abouhalima, the Blind Sheikh, and Ramzi\n",
      "Yousef, for crimes related to the World Trade Center bombing and other plots.\n",
      "\n",
      "An unfortunate consequence of this superb investigative and prosecutorial\n",
      "effort was that it created an impression that the law enforcement system was\n",
      "well-equipped to cope with terrorism. Neither President Clinton, his principal\n",
      "advisers, the Congress, nor the news media felt prompted, until later, to press\n",
      "the question of whether the procedures that put the Blind Sheikh and Ramzi\n",
      "Yousef behind bars would really protect Americans against the new virus of\n",
      "which these individuals were just the first symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the successful use of the legal system to address the first World Trade\n",
      "Center bombing had the side effect of obscuring the need to examine the character\n",
      "and extent of the new threat facing the United States. The trials did not\n",
      "bring the Bin Ladin network to the attention of the public and policymakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FBI assembled, and the U.S. Attorney’s office put forward, some evidence\n",
      "showing that the men in the dock were not the only plotters. Materials\n",
      "taken from Ajaj indicated that the plot or plots were hatched at or near the\n",
      "Khaldan camp, a terrorist training camp on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.\n",
      "Ajaj had left Texas in April 1992 to go there to learn how to construct bombs.\n",
      "He had met Ramzi Yousef in Pakistan, where they discussed bombing targets\n",
      "in the United States and assembled a “terrorist kit” that included bomb-making\n",
      "manuals, operations guidance, videotapes advocating terrorist action\n",
      "against the United States, and false identification documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yousef was captured in Pakistan following the discovery by police in the\n",
      "Philippines in January 1995 of the Manila air plot, which envisioned placing\n",
      "bombs on board a dozen trans-Pacific airliners and setting them off simultaneously.\n",
      "Khalid Sheikh Mohammed—Yousef’s uncle, then located in Qatar — was\n",
      "a fellow plotter of Yousef’s in the Manila air plot and had also wired him some\n",
      "money prior to the Trade Center bombing. The U.S. Attorney obtained an\n",
      "indictment against KSM in January 1996, but an official in the government of\n",
      "Qatar probably warned him about it. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed evaded capture\n",
      "(and stayed at large to play a central part in the 9/11 attacks).\n",
      "\n",
      "The law enforcement process is concerned with proving the guilt of persons\n",
      "apprehended and charged. Investigators and prosecutors could not present\n",
      "all the evidence of possible involvement of individuals other than those\n",
      "charged, although they continued to pursue such investigations, planning or\n",
      "hoping for later prosecutions. The process was meant, by its nature, to mark for\n",
      "the public the events as finished—case solved, justice done. It was not designed\n",
      "to ask if the events might be harbingers of worse to come. Nor did it allow for\n",
      "aggregating and analyzing facts to see if they could provide clues to terrorist\n",
      "tactics more generally — methods of entry and finance, and mode of operation\n",
      "inside the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, although the bombing heightened awareness of a new terrorist danger,\n",
      "successful prosecutions contributed to widespread underestimation of the\n",
      "threat. The government’s attorneys stressed the seriousness of the crimes, and\n",
      "put forward evidence of Yousef ’s technical ingenuity. Yet the public image that\n",
      "persisted was not of clever Yousef but of stupid Salameh going back again and\n",
      "again to reclaim his $400 truck rental deposit.\n",

      "<h3>3.2 ADAPTATION — AND NONADAPTATION — IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY</h3>\n",
      "Legal processes were the primary method for responding to these early manifestations\n",
      "of a new type of terrorism. Our overview of U.S. capabilities for dealing\n",
      "with it thus begins with the nation’s vast complex of law enforcement\n",
      "agencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "<h4>The Justice Department and the FBI</h4>\n",
      "At the federal level, much law enforcement activity is concentrated in the\n",
      "Department of Justice. For countering terrorism, the dominant agency under\n",
      "Justice is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI does not have a general\n",
      "grant of authority but instead works under specific statutory authorizations.\n",
      "Most of its work is done in local offices called field offices. There are 56 of\n",
      "them, each covering a specified geographic area, and each quite separate from\n",
      "all others. Prior to 9/11, the special agent in charge was in general free to set\n",
      "his or her office’s priorities and assign personnel accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The office’s priorities were driven by two primary concerns. First, performance\n",
      "in the Bureau was generally measured against statistics such as numbers\n",
      "of arrests, indictments, prosecutions, and convictions. Counterterrorism and\n",
      "counterintelligence work, often involving lengthy intelligence investigations\n",
      "that might never have positive or quantifiable results, was not career-enhancing.\n",
      "Most agents who reached management ranks had little counterterrorism\n",
      "experience. Second, priorities were driven at the local level by the field offices,\n",
      "whose concerns centered on traditional crimes such as white-collar offenses\n",
      "and those pertaining to drugs and gangs. Individual field offices made choices\n",
      "to serve local priorities, not national priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bureau also operates under an “office of origin” system. To avoid duplication\n",
      "and possible conflicts, the FBI designates a single office to be in charge\n",
      "of an entire investigation. Because the New York Field Office indicted Bin\n",
      "Ladin prior to the East Africa bombings, it became the office of origin for all\n",
      "Bin Ladin cases, including the East Africa bombings and later the attack on the\n",
      "USS Cole. Most of the FBI’s institutional knowledge on Bin Ladin and al Qaeda\n",
      "resided there. This office worked closely with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern\n",
      "District of New York to identify, arrest, prosecute, and convict many of the\n",
      "perpetrators of the attacks and plots. Field offices other than the specified office\n",
      "of origin were often reluctant to spend much energy on matters over which\n",
      "they had no control and for which they received no credit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FBI’s domestic intelligence gathering dates from the 1930s. With World\n",
      "War II looming, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered FBI Director J. Edgar\n",
      "Hoover to investigate foreign and foreign-inspired subversion—Communist,\n",
      "Nazi, and Japanese. Hoover added investigation of possible espionage, sabotage,\n",
      "or subversion to the duties of field offices. After the war, foreign intelligence\n",
      "duties were assigned to the newly established Central Intelligence Agency.\n",
      "Hoover jealously guarded the FBI’s domestic portfolio against all rivals.\n",
      "Hoover felt he was accountable only to the president, and the FBI’s domestic\n",
      "intelligence activities kept growing. In the 1960s, the FBI was receiving significant\n",
      "assistance within the United States from the CIA and from Army Intelligence.\n",
      "The legal basis for some of this assistance was dubious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decades of encouragement to perform as a domestic intelligence agency\n",
      "abruptly ended in the 1970s. Two years after Hoover’s death in 1972, congressional and news media investigations of the Watergate scandals of the Nixon\n",
      "administration expanded into general investigations of foreign and domestic\n",
      "intelligence by the Church and Pike committees.\n",
      "\n",
      "They disclosed domestic\n",
      "intelligence efforts, which included a covert action program that operated from\n",
      "1956 to 1971 against domestic organizations and, eventually, domestic dissidents.\n",
      "The FBI had spied on a wide range of political figures, especially individuals\n",
      "whom Hoover wanted to discredit (notably the Reverend Martin\n",
      "Luther King, Jr.), and had authorized unlawful wiretaps and surveillance. The\n",
      "shock registered in public opinion polls, where the percentage of Americans\n",
      "declaring a “highly favorable” view of the FBI dropped from 84 percent to 37\n",
      "percent. The FBI’s Domestic Intelligence Division was dissolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1976, Attorney General Edward Levi adopted domestic security guidelines\n",
      "to regulate intelligence collection in the United States and to deflect calls\n",
      "for even stronger regulation. In 1983, Attorney General William French Smith\n",
      "revised the Levi guidelines to encourage closer investigation of potential terrorism.\n",
      "He also loosened the rules governing authorization for investigations\n",
      "and their duration. Still, his guidelines, like Levi’s, took account of the reality\n",
      "that suspicion of “terrorism,” like suspicion of “subversion,” could lead to making\n",
      "individuals targets for investigation more because of their beliefs than\n",
      "because of their acts. Smith’s guidelines also took account of the reality that\n",
      "potential terrorists were often members of extremist religious organizations and\n",
      "that investigation of terrorism could cross the line separating state and\n",
      "church.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1986, Congress authorized the FBI to investigate terrorist attacks against\n",
      "Americans that occur outside the United States. Three years later, it added\n",
      "authority for the FBI to make arrests abroad without consent from the host\n",
      "country. Meanwhile, a task force headed by Vice President George H.W. Bush\n",
      "had endorsed a concept already urged by Director of Central Intelligence\n",
      "William Casey — a Counterterrorist Center, where the FBI, the CIA, and other\n",
      "organizations could work together on international terrorism. While it was distinctly\n",
      "a CIA entity, the FBI detailed officials to work at the Center and\n",
      "obtained leads that helped in the capture of persons wanted for trial in the\n",
      "United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strengths that the FBI brought to counterterrorism were nowhere more\n",
      "brilliantly on display than in the case of Pan American Flight 103, bound from\n",
      "London to New York, which blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December\n",
      "1988, killing 270 people. Initial evidence pointed to the government of Syria\n",
      "and, later, Iran. The Counterterrorist Center reserved judgment on the perpetrators\n",
      "of the attack. Meanwhile, FBI technicians, working with U.K. security\n",
      "services, gathered and analyzed the widely scattered fragments of the airliner.\n",
      "In 1991, with the help of the Counterterrorist Center, they identified one small\n",
      "fragment as part of a timing device—to the technicians, as distinctive as DNA.\n",
      "It was a Libyan device. Together with other evidence, the FBI put together a case pointing conclusively to the Libyan government. Eventually Libya\n",
      "acknowledged its responsibility.\n",
      "Pan Am 103 became a cautionary tale\n",
      "against rushing to judgment in attributing responsibility for a terrorist act. It\n",
      "also showed again how — given a case to solve — the FBI remained capable of\n",
      "extraordinary investigative success.\n",
      "\n",
      "<h4>FBI Organization and Priorities</h4>\n",
      "In 1993, President Clinton chose Louis Freeh as the Director of the Bureau.\n",
      "Freeh, who would remain Director until June 2001, believed that the FBI’s\n",
      "work should be done primarily by the field offices. To emphasize this view he\n",
      "cut headquarters staff and decentralized operations. The special agents in charge\n",
      "gained power, influence, and independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Freeh recognized terrorism as a major threat. He increased the number of\n",
      "legal attaché offices abroad, focusing in particular on the Middle East. He also\n",
      "urged agents not to wait for terrorist acts to occur before taking action. In his\n",
      "first budget request to Congress after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing,\n",
      "he stated that “merely solving this type of crime is not enough; it is equally\n",
      "important that the FBI thwart terrorism before such acts can be perpetrated.”\n",
      "Within headquarters, he created a Counterterrorism Division that would complement\n",
      "the Counterterrorist Center at the CIA and arranged for exchanges\n",
      "of senior FBI and CIA counterterrorism officials. He pressed for more cooperation\n",
      "between legal attachés and CIA stations abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Freeh’s efforts did not, however, translate into a significant shift of resources\n",
      "to counterterrorism. FBI, Justice, and Office of Management and Budget officials\n",
      "said that FBI leadership seemed unwilling to shift resources to terrorism\n",
      "from other areas such as violent crime and drug enforcement; other FBI officials\n",
      "blamed Congress and the OMB for a lack of political will and failure to\n",
      "understand the FBI’s counterterrorism resource needs. In addition, Freeh did\n",
      "not impose his views on the field offices. With a few notable exceptions, the\n",
      "field offices did not apply significant resources to terrorism and often reprogrammed\n",
      "funds for other priorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1998, the FBI issued a five-year strategic plan led by its deputy director,\n",
      "Robert “Bear” Bryant. For the first time, the FBI designated national and economic\n",
      "security, including counterterrorism, as its top priority. Dale Watson, who\n",
      "would later become the head of the new Counterterrorism Division, said that\n",
      "after the East Africa bombings, “the light came on” that cultural change had to\n",
      "occur within the FBI. The plan mandated a stronger intelligence collection effort.\n",
      "It called for a nationwide automated system to facilitate information collection,\n",
      "analysis, and dissemination. It envisioned the creation of a professional intelligence\n",
      "cadre of experienced and trained agents and analysts. If successfully implemented,\n",
      "this would have been a major step toward addressing terrorism systematically,\n",
      "rather than as individual unrelated cases. But the plan did not succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the plan did not obtain the necessary human resources. Despite designating “national and economic security” as its top priority in 1998, the\n",
      "FBI did not shift human resources accordingly. Although the FBI’s counterterrorism\n",
      "budget tripled during the mid-1990s, FBI counterterrorism\n",
      "spending remained fairly constant between fiscal years 1998 and 2001. In\n",
      "2000, there were still twice as many agents devoted to drug enforcement as\n",
      "to counterterrorism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the new division intended to strengthen the FBI’s strategic analysis\n",
      "capability faltered. It received insufficient resources and faced resistance from\n",
      "senior managers in the FBI’s operational divisions. The new division was supposed\n",
      "to identify trends in terrorist activity, determine what the FBI did not\n",
      "know, and ultimately drive collection efforts. However, the FBI had little appreciation\n",
      "for the role of analysis. Analysts continued to be used primarily in a tactical\n",
      "fashion—providing support for existing cases. Compounding the problem\n",
      "was the FBI’s tradition of hiring analysts from within instead of recruiting individuals\n",
      "with the relevant educational background and expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, analysts had difficulty getting access to the FBI and intelligence\n",
      "community information they were expected to analyze. The poor state of the\n",
      "FBI’s information systems meant that such access depended in large part on an\n",
      "analyst’s personal relationships with individuals in the operational units or\n",
      "squads where the information resided. For all of these reasons, prior to 9/11\n",
      "relatively few strategic analytic reports about counterterrorism had been completed.\n",
      "Indeed, the FBI had never completed an assessment of the overall terrorist\n",
      "threat to the U.S. homeland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the FBI did not have an effective intelligence collection effort. Collection\n",
      "of intelligence from human sources was limited, and agents were inadequately\n",
      "trained. Only three days of a 16-week agents’ course were devoted to\n",
      "counterintelligence and counterterrorism, and most subsequent training was\n",
      "received on the job. The FBI did not have an adequate mechanism for validating\n",
      "source reporting, nor did it have a system for adequately tracking and sharing\n",
      "source reporting, either internally or externally. The FBI did not dedicate\n",
      "sufficient resources to the surveillance and translation needs of counterterrorism\n",
      "agents. It lacked sufficient translators proficient in Arabic and other\n",
      "key languages, resulting in a significant backlog of untranslated intercepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the FBI’s information systems were woefully inadequate. The FBI\n",
      "lacked the ability to know what it knew: there was no effective mechanism for\n",
      "capturing or sharing its institutional knowledge. FBI agents did create records of\n",
      "interviews and other investigative efforts, but there were no reports officers to\n",
      "condense the information into meaningful intelligence that could be retrieved\n",
      "and disseminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1999, the FBI created separate Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence\n",
      "divisions. Dale Watson, the first head of the new Counterterrorism Division,\n",
      "recognized the urgent need to increase the FBI’s counterterrorism\n",
      "capability. His plan, called MAXCAP 05, was unveiled in 2000: it set the goal\n",
      "of bringing the Bureau to its “maximum feasible capacity” in counterterrorism\n",
      "by 2005. Field executives told Watson that they did not have the analysts,\n",
      "linguists, or technically trained experts to carry out the strategy. In a report provided\n",
      "to Director Robert Mueller in September 2001, one year after Watson\n",
      "presented his plan to field executives, almost every FBI field office was assessed\n",
      "to be operating below “maximum capacity.” The report stated that “the goal to\n",
      "‘prevent terrorism’ requires a dramatic shift in emphasis from a reactive capability\n",
      "to highly functioning intelligence capability which provides not only\n",
      "leads and operational support, but clear strategic analysis and direction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "<h4>Legal Constraints on the FBI and “the Wall”</h4>\n",
      "The FBI had different tools for law enforcement and intelligence.\n",
      "For criminal\n",
      "matters, it could apply for and use traditional criminal warrants. For intelligence\n",
      "matters involving international terrorism, however, the rules were\n",
      "different. For many years the attorney general could authorize surveillance of\n",
      "foreign powers and agents of foreign powers without any court review, but in\n",
      "1978 Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. This law regulated\n",
      "intelligence collection directed at foreign powers and agents of foreign\n",
      "powers in the United States. In addition to requiring court review of proposed\n",
      "surveillance (and later, physical searches), the 1978 act was interpreted by the\n",
      "courts to require that a search be approved only if its “primary purpose” was\n",
      "to obtain foreign intelligence information. In other words, the authorities of\n",
      "the FISA law could not be used to circumvent traditional criminal warrant\n",
      "requirements. The Justice Department interpreted these rulings as saying that\n",
      "criminal prosecutors could be briefed on FISA information but could not\n",
      "direct or control its collection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Justice prosecutors had informal\n",
      "arrangements for obtaining information gathered in the FISA process, the\n",
      "understanding being that they would not improperly exploit that process for\n",
      "their criminal cases. Whether the FBI shared with prosecutors information\n",
      "pertinent to possible criminal investigations was left solely to the judgment of\n",
      "the FBI.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the prosecution of Aldrich Ames for espionage in 1994 revived concerns\n",
      "about the prosecutors’ role in intelligence investigations. The Department\n",
      "of Justice’s Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) is responsible for\n",
      "reviewing and presenting all FISA applications to the FISA Court. It worried\n",
      "that because of the numerous prior consultations between FBI agents and prosecutors,\n",
      "the judge might rule that the FISA warrants had been misused. If that\n",
      "had happened, Ames might have escaped conviction. Richard Scruggs, the acting\n",

      "<h3> 3.3 AND IN THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION </h3>\n",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) within the Department of Transportation\n",
      "had been vested by Congress with the sometimes conflicting mandate\n",
      "of regulating the safety and security of U.S. civil aviation while also\n",
      "promoting the civil aviation industry. The FAA had a security mission to protect\n",
      "the users of commercial air transportation against terrorism and other\n",
      "criminal acts. In the years before 9/11, the FAA perceived sabotage as a greater\n",
      "threat to aviation than hijacking. First, no domestic hijacking had occurred in\n",
      "a decade. Second, the commercial aviation system was perceived as more vulnerable\n",
      "to explosives than to weapons such as firearms. Finally, explosives were perceived as deadlier than hijacking and therefore of greater consequence. In\n",
      "1996, a presidential commission on aviation safety and security chaired by Vice\n",
      "President Al Gore reinforced the prevailing concern about sabotage and explosives\n",
      "on aircraft. The Gore Commission also flagged, as a new danger, the possibility\n",
      "of attack by surface-to-air missiles. Its 1997 final report did not discuss\n",
      "the possibility of suicide hijackings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FAA set and enforced aviation security rules, which airlines and airports\n",
      "were required to implement. The rules were supposed to produce a “layered”\n",
      "system of defense. This meant that the failure of any one layer of security\n",
      "would not be fatal, because additional layers would provide backup security.\n",
      "But each layer relevant to hijackings — intelligence, passenger prescreening,\n",
      "checkpoint screening, and onboard security — was seriously flawed prior to\n",
      "9/11. Taken together, they did not stop any of the 9/11 hijackers from getting\n",
      "on board four different aircraft at three different airports.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FAA’s policy was to use intelligence to identify both specific plots and\n",
      "general threats to civil aviation security, so that the agency could develop and\n",
      "deploy appropriate countermeasures. The FAA’s 40-person intelligence unit\n",
      "was supposed to receive a broad range of intelligence data from the FBI, CIA,\n",
      "and other agencies so that it could make assessments about the threat to aviation.\n",
      "But the large volume of data contained little pertaining to the presence\n",
      "and activities of terrorists in the United States. For example, information on\n",
      "the FBI’s effort in 1998 to assess the potential use of flight training by terrorists\n",
      "and the Phoenix electronic communication of 2001 warning of radical\n",
      "Middle Easterners attending flight school were not passed to FAA headquarters.\n",
      "Several top FAA intelligence officials called the domestic threat picture a\n",
      "serious blind spot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the FAA’s intelligence unit did not receive much attention from\n",
      "the agency’s leadership. Neither Administrator Jane Garvey nor her deputy routinely\n",
      "reviewed daily intelligence, and what they did see was screened for them.\n",
      "She was unaware of a great amount of hijacking threat information from her\n",
      "own intelligence unit, which, in turn, was not deeply involved in the agency’s\n",
      "policymaking process. Historically, decisive security action took place only after\n",
      "a disaster had occurred or a specific plot had been discovered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next aviation security layer was passenger prescreening. The FAA\n",
      "directed air carriers not to fly individuals known to pose a “direct” threat to\n",
      "civil aviation. But as of 9/11, the FAA’s “no-fly” list contained the names of\n",
      "just 12 terrorist suspects (including 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh\n",
      "Mohammed), even though government watchlists contained the names of\n",
      "many thousands of known and suspected terrorists. This astonishing mismatch\n",
      "existed despite the Gore Commission’s having called on the FBI and CIA four\n",
      "years earlier to provide terrorist watchlists to improve prescreening. The longtime\n",
      "chief of the FAA’s civil aviation security division testified that he was not\n",
      "even aware of the State Department’s TIPOFF list of known and suspected terrorists (some 60,000 before 9/11) until he heard it mentioned during the\n",
      "Commission’s January 26, 2004, public hearing. The FAA had access to some\n",
      "TIPOFF data, but apparently found it too difficult to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second part of prescreening called on the air carriers to implement an\n",
      "FAA-approved computerized algorithm (known as CAPPS, for Computer\n",
      "Assisted Passenger Prescreening System) designed to identify passengers whose\n",
      "profile suggested they might pose more than a minimal risk to aircraft.\n",
      "Although the algorithm included hijacker profile data, at that time only passengers\n",
      "checking bags were eligible to be selected by CAPPS for additional\n",
      "scrutiny. Selection entailed only having one’s checked baggage screened for\n",
      "explosives or held off the airplane until one had boarded. Primarily because of\n",
      "concern regarding potential discrimination and the impact on passenger\n",
      "throughput, “selectees” were no longer required to undergo extraordinary\n",
      "screening of their carry-on baggage as had been the case before the system was\n",
      "computerized in 1997. This policy change also reflected the perception that\n",
      "nonsuicide sabotage was the primary threat to civil aviation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Checkpoint screening was considered the most important and obvious layer\n",
      "of security. Walk-through metal detectors and X-ray machines operated by\n",
      "trained screeners were employed to stop prohibited items. Numerous government\n",
      "reports indicated that checkpoints performed poorly, often failing to\n",
      "detect even obvious FAA test items. Many deadly and dangerous items did not\n",
      "set off metal detectors, or were hard to distinguish in an X-ray machine from\n",
      "innocent everyday items.\n",
      "\n",
      "While FAA rules did not expressly prohibit knives with blades under 4\n",
      "inches long, the airlines’ checkpoint operations guide (which was developed in\n",
      "cooperation with the FAA), explicitly permitted them. The FAA’s basis for this\n",
      "policy was (1) the agency did not consider such items to be menacing, (2) most\n",
      "local laws did not prohibit individuals from carrying such knives, and (3) such\n",
      "knives would have been difficult to detect unless the sensitivity of metal detectors\n",
      "had been greatly increased. A proposal to ban knives altogether in 1993\n",
      "had been rejected because small cutting implements were difficult to detect and\n",
      "the number of innocent “alarms” would have increased significantly, exacerbating\n",
      "congestion problems at checkpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several years prior to 9/11, an FAA requirement for screeners to conduct\n",
      "“continuous” and “random” hand searches of carry-on luggage at checkpoints\n",
      "had been replaced by explosive trace detection or had simply become ignored\n",
      "by the air carriers. Therefore, secondary screening of individuals and their\n",
      "carry-on bags to identify weapons (other than bombs) was nonexistent, except\n",
      "for passengers who triggered the metal detectors. Even when small knives were\n",
      "detected by secondary screening, they were usually returned to the traveler.\n",
      "Reportedly, the 9/11 hijackers were instructed to use items that would be\n",
      "undetectable by airport checkpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the pre-9/11 security system, the air carriers played a major role. As the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation told us, there were great\n",
      "pressures from the air carriers to control security costs and to “limit the impact\n",
      "of security requirements on aviation operations, so that the industry could concentrate\n",
      "on its primary mission of moving passengers and aircraft.... hose\n",
      "counterpressures in turn manifested themselves as significant weaknesses in\n",
      "security.” A longtime FAA security official described the air carriers’ approach\n",
      "to security regulation as “decry, deny and delay” and told us that while “the air\n",
      "carriers had seen the enlightened hand of self-interest with respect to safety,\n",
      "they hadn’t seen it in the security arena.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The final layer, security on board commercial aircraft, was not designed to\n",
      "counter suicide hijackings. The FAA-approved “Common Strategy” had been\n",
      "elaborated over decades of experience with scores of hijackings, beginning in\n",
      "the 1960s. It taught flight crews that the best way to deal with hijackers was to\n",
      "accommodate their demands, get the plane to land safely, and then let law\n",
      "enforcement or the military handle the situation. According to the FAA, the\n",
      "record had shown that the longer a hijacking persisted, the more likely it was\n",
      "to end peacefully. The strategy operated on the fundamental assumption that\n",
      "hijackers issue negotiable demands (most often for asylum or the release of prisoners)\n",
      "and that, as one FAA official put it, “suicide wasn’t in the game plan” of\n",
      "hijackers. FAA training material provided no guidance for flight crews should\n",
      "violence occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "This prevailing Common Strategy of cooperation and nonconfrontation\n",
      "meant that even a hardened cockpit door would have made little difference in\n",
      "a hijacking. As the chairman of the Security Committee of the Air Line Pilots\n",
      "Association observed when proposals were made in early 2001 to install reinforced\n",
      "cockpit doors in commercial aircraft,“Even if you make a vault out of\n",
      "the door, if they have a noose around my flight attendant’s neck, I’m going to\n",
      "open the door.” Prior to 9/11, FAA regulations mandated that cockpit doors\n",
      "permit ready access into and out of the cockpit in the event of an emergency.\n",
      "Even so, rules implemented in the 1960s required air crews to keep the cockpit\n",
      "door closed and locked in flight. This requirement was not always observed\n",
      "or vigorously enforced.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for law enforcement, there were only 33 armed and trained federal air\n",
      "marshals as of 9/11. They were not deployed on U.S. domestic flights, except\n",
      "when in transit to provide security on international departures. This policy\n",
      "reflected the FAA’s view that domestic hijacking was in check—a view held\n",
      "confidently as no terrorist had hijacked a U.S. commercial aircraft anywhere in\n",
      "the world since 1986.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the absence of any recent aviation security incident and without “specific\n",
      "and credible” evidence of a plot directed at civil aviation, the FAA’s leadership\n",
      "focused elsewhere, including on operational concerns and the\n",
      "ever-present issue of safety. FAA Administrator Garvey recalled that “every day\n",
      "in 2001 was like the day before Thanksgiving.” Heeding calls for improved air service, Congress concentrated its efforts on a “passenger bill of rights,” to\n",

      "During the 1990s, the rise of round-the-clock news shows and the Internet\n",
      "reinforced pressure on analysts to pass along fresh reports to policymakers at an\n",

      "to cope with the new terrorism traced back to the early Cold War, when the\n",

      "Soviet KGB. James Jesus Angleton, who headed counterintelligence in the CIA\n",
      "until the early 1970s, became obsessed with the belief that the Agency harbored\n",
      "one or more Soviet “moles.”Although the pendulum swung back after Angleton’s\n",
      "forced retirement, it did not go very far. Instances of actual Soviet penetration\n",
      "kept apprehensions high.\n",
      "Then, in the early 1990s, came the Aldrich\n",
      "Ames espionage case, which intensely embarrassed the CIA. Though obviously\n",
      "unreliable, Ames had been protected and promoted by fellow officers while he\n",
      "paid his bills by selling to the Soviet Union the names of U.S. operatives and\n",
      "agents, a number of whom died as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concern about security vastly complicated information sharing. Information\n",
      "was compartmented in order to protect it against exposure to skilled and\n",
      "technologically sophisticated adversaries. There were therefore numerous\n",
      "restrictions on handling information and a deep suspicion about sending information over newfangled electronic systems, like email, to other agencies of the\n",
      "U.S. government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Security concerns also increased the difficulty of recruiting officers qualified\n",
      "for counterterrorism. Very few American colleges or universities offered\n",
      "programs in Middle Eastern languages or Islamic studies. The total number of\n",
      "undergraduate degrees granted in Arabic in all U.S. colleges and universities in\n",
      "2002 was six.\n",
      "Many who had traveled much outside the United States could\n",
      "expect a very long wait for initial clearance. Anyone who was foreign-born or\n",
      "had numerous relatives abroad was well-advised not even to apply. With budgets\n",
      "for the CIA shrinking after the end of the Cold War, it was not surprising\n",
      "that, with some notable exceptions, new hires in the Clandestine Service\n",
      "tended to have qualifications similar to those of serving officers: that is, they\n",
      "were suited for traditional agent recruitment or for exploiting liaison relationships\n",
      "with foreign services but were not equipped to seek or use assets inside\n",
      "the terrorist network.\n",
      "<h3>Early Counterterrorism Efforts</h3>\n",
      "In the 1970s and 1980s, terrorism had been tied to regional conflicts, mainly\n",
      "in the Middle East. The majority of terrorist groups either were sponsored by\n",
      "governments or, like the Palestine Liberation Organization, were militants trying\n",
      "to create governments.\n",

      "Center had representation from the FBI and other agencies. In the formal\n",
      "table of organization it reported to the DCI, but in fact most of the Center’s\n",
      "chiefs belonged to the Clandestine Service and usually looked for guidance to\n",
      "the head of the Directorate of Operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Center stimulated and coordinated collection of information by CIA\n",
      "stations, compiled the results, and passed selected reports to appropriate stations,\n",
      "the Directorate of Intelligence analysts, other parts of the intelligence community,\n",
      "or to policymakers. The Center protected its bureaucratic turf. The Director\n",
      "of Central Intelligence had once had a national intelligence officer for\n",
      "terrorism to coordinate analysis; that office was abolished in the late 1980s and\n",
      "its duties absorbed in part by the Counterterrorist Center. Though analysts\n",
      "assigned to the Center produced a large number of papers, the focus was support\n",
      "to operations. A CIA inspector general’s report in 1994 criticized the Center’s\n",
      "capacity to provide warning of terrorist attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequent chapters will raise the issue of whether, despite tremendous talent,\n",
      "energy, and dedication, the intelligence community failed to do enough in\n",
      "coping with the challenge from Bin Ladin and al Qaeda. Confronted with such\n",
      "questions, managers in the intelligence community often responded that they\n",
      "had meager resources with which to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cuts in national security expenditures at the end of the Cold War led to\n",
      "budget cuts in the national foreign intelligence program from fiscal years 1990\n",
      "to 1996 and essentially flat budgets from fiscal years 1996 to 2000 (except for\n",
      "the so-called Gingrich supplemental to the FY1999 budget and two later,\n",
      "smaller supplementals). These cuts compounded the difficulties of the intelligence\n",
      "agencies. Policymakers were asking them to move into the digitized\n",
      "future to fight against computer-to-computer communications and modern\n",
      "communication systems, while maintaining capability against older systems,\n",
      "such as high-frequency radios and ultra-high- and very-high-frequency (line\n",
      "of sight) systems that work like old-style television antennas. Also, demand for\n",
      "imagery increased dramatically following the success of the 1991 Gulf War.\n",
      "Both these developments, in turn, placed a premium on planning the next generation\n",
      "of satellite systems, the cost of which put great pressure on the rest of\n",
      "the intelligence budget. As a result, intelligence agencies experienced staff\n",
      "reductions, affecting both operators and analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet at least for the CIA, part of the burden in tackling terrorism arose from\n",
      "the background we have described: an organization capable of attracting\n",
      "extraordinarily motivated people but institutionally averse to risk, with its\n",
      "capacity for covert action atrophied, predisposed to restrict the distribution of\n",
      "information, having difficulty assimilating new types of personnel, and accustomed\n",
      "to presenting descriptive reportage of the latest intelligence. The CIA,\n",
      "to put it another way, needed significant change in order to get maximum effect\n",
      "in counterterrorism. President Clinton appointed George Tenet as DCI in\n",
      "1997, and by all accounts terrorism was a priority for him. But Tenet’s own\n",
      "assessment, when questioned by the Commission, was that in 2004, the CIA’s\n",
      "clandestine service was still at least five years away from being fully ready to\n",
      "play its counterterrorism role.\n",
      "And while Tenet was clearly the leader of the\n",
      "CIA, the intelligence community’s confederated structure left open the question\n",
      "of who really was in charge of the entire U.S. intelligence effort.\n",
      "<h3>3.5 AND IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT</h3>\n",
      "<h4>The State Department</h4>\n",
      "The Commission asked Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage in 2004\n",
      "why the State Department had so long pursued what seemed, and ultimately\n",

      "forum where the military could object if they thought the State Department\n",
      "was setting national objectives that the United States did not have the wherewithal\n",
      "to pursue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The State Department retained primacy until the 1960s, when the\n",
      "Kennedy and Johnson administrations turned instead to Robert McNamara’s\n",

      "foreign policy issues. President Richard Nixon then concentrated policy planning\n",
      "and policy coordination in a powerful National Security Council staff,\n",
      "overseen by Henry Kissinger.\n",
      "In later years, individual secretaries of state were important figures, but the\n",
      "department’s role continued to erode. State came into the 1990s overmatched\n",
      "by the resources of other departments and with little support for its budget\n",
      "either in the Congress or in the president’s Office of Management and Budget.\n",
      "Like the FBI and the CIA’s Directorate of Operations, the State Department\n",
      "had a tradition of emphasizing service in the field over service in Washington.\n",
      "Even ambassadors, however, often found host governments not only making\n",
      "connections with the U.S. government through their own missions in Washington,\n",
      "but working through the CIA station or a Defense attaché. Increasingly,\n",
      "the embassies themselves were overshadowed by powerful regional commanders\n",

      "<h4>Counter-terrorism</h4>\n",
      "In the 1960s and 1970s, the State Department managed counter-terrorism policy.\n",
      "It was the official channel for communication with the governments presumed\n",
      "to be behind the terrorists. Moreover, since terrorist incidents of this\n",
      "period usually ended in negotiations, an ambassador or other embassy official\n",
      "was the logical person to represent U.S. interests.\n",
      "Keeping U.S. diplomatic efforts against terrorism coherent was a recurring\n",
      "challenge. In 1976, at the direction of Congress, the department elevated its\n",
      "coordinator for combating terrorism to the rank equivalent to an assistant secretary\n",
      "of state. As an “ambassador at large,” this official sought to increase the\n",
      "visibility of counterterrorism matters within the department and to help integrate\n",
      "U.S. policy implementation among government agencies. The prolonged\n",
      "crisis of 1979–1981, when 53 Americans were held hostage at the U.S. embassy\n",
      "in Tehran, ended the State Department leadership in counterterrorism. President\n",
      "Carter’s assertive national security advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, took\n",
      "charge, and the coordination function remained thereafter in the White House.\n",
      "President Reagan’s second secretary of state, George Shultz, advocated active\n",
      "U.S. efforts to combat terrorism, often recommending the use of military force.\n",
      "Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger opposed Shultz, who made little headway against Weinberger, or even within his own department. Though Shultz\n",
      "elevated the status and visibility of counterterrorism coordination by appointing\n",
      "as coordinator first L. Paul Bremer and then Robert Oakley, both senior\n",
      "career ambassadors of high standing in the Foreign Service, the department\n",
      "continued to be dominated by regional bureaus for which terrorism was not a\n",
      "first-order concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secretaries of state after Shultz took less personal interest in the problem.\n",
      "Only congressional opposition prevented President Clinton’s first secretary of\n",
      "state, Warren Christopher, from merging terrorism into a new bureau that\n",
      "would have also dealt with narcotics and crime. The coordinator under Secretary\n",
      "Madeleine Albright told the Commission that his job was seen as a minor\n",
      "one within the department.\n",
      "Although the description of his status has been\n",
      "disputed, and Secretary Albright strongly supported the August 1998 strikes\n",
      "against Bin Ladin, the role played by the Department of State in counterterrorism\n",
      "was often cautionary before 9/11. This was a reflection of the reality\n",
      "that counterterrorism priorities nested within broader foreign policy aims of\n",
      "the U.S. government.\n",
      "\n",
      "State Department consular officers around the world, it should not be forgotten,\n",
      "were constantly challenged by the problem of terrorism, for they handled\n",
      "visas for travel to the United States. After it was discovered that Abdel\n",
      "Rahman, the Blind Sheikh, had come and gone almost at will, State initiated\n",
      "significant reforms to its watchlist and visa-processing policies. In 1993, Congress\n",
      "passed legislation allowing State to retain visa-processing fees for border\n",
      "security; those fees were then used by the department to fully automate the\n",
      "terrorist watchlist. By the late 1990s, State had created a worldwide, real-time\n",
      "electronic database of visa, law enforcement, and watchlist information, the core\n",
      "of the post-9/11 border screening systems. Still, as will be seen later, the system\n",
      "had many holes.\n",
      "\n",
      "<h4>The Department of Defense</h4>\n",
      "The Department of Defense is the behemoth among federal agencies. With an\n",
      "annual budget larger than the gross domestic product of Russia, it is an empire.\n",
      "The Defense Department is part civilian, part military. The civilian secretary of\n",
      "defense has ultimate control, under the president. Among the uniformed military,\n",
      "the top official is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is supported\n",
      "by a Joint Staff divided into standard military staff compartments—J-2\n",
      "(intelligence), J-3 (operations), and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the necessary and demanding focus on the differing mission of\n",
      "each service, and their long and proud traditions, the Army, Navy, Air Force,\n",
      "and Marine Corps have often fought ferociously over roles and missions in war\n",
      "fighting and over budgets and posts of leadership. Two developments diminished\n",
      "this competition.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first was the passage by Congress in 1986 of the Goldwater-Nichols Act, which, among other things, mandated that promotion to high rank\n",
      "required some period of duty with a different service or with a joint (i.e.,\n",
      "multiservice) command. This had strong and immediate effects, loosening the\n",
      "loyalties of senior officers to their separate services and causing them to think\n",
      "more broadly about the military establishment as a whole.\n",
      "However, it also\n",
      "may have lessened the diversity of military advice and options presented to the\n",
      "president. The Goldwater-Nichols example is seen by some as having lessons\n",
      "applicable to lessening competition and increasing cooperation in other parts\n",
      "of the federal bureaucracy, particularly the law enforcement and intelligence\n",
      "communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second, related development was a significant transfer of planning and\n",
      "command responsibilities from the service chiefs and their staffs to the joint\n",
      "and unified commands outside of Washington, especially those for Strategic\n",
      "Forces and for four regions:Europe, the Pacific, the Center, and the South. Posts\n",
      "in these commands became prized assignments for ambitious officers, and the\n",
      "voices of their five commanders in chief became as influential as those of the\n",
      "service chiefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "<h3>Counter-terrorism</h3>\n",
      "The Pentagon first became concerned about terrorism as a result of hostage\n",
      "taking in the 1970s. In June 1976, Palestinian terrorists seized an Air France\n",
      "plane and landed it at Entebbe in Uganda, holding 105 Israelis and other Jews\n",
      "as hostages. A special Israeli commando force stormed the plane, killed all the\n",
      "terrorists, and rescued all but one of the hostages. In October 1977, a West German\n",
      "special force dealt similarly with a Lufthansa plane sitting on a tarmac in\n",
      "Mogadishu: every terrorist was killed, and every hostage brought back safely.\n",
      "The White House, members of Congress, and the news media asked the Pentagon\n",
      "whether the United States was prepared for similar action. The answer\n",
      "was no. The Army immediately set about creating the Delta Force, one of\n",
      "whose missions was hostage rescue.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first test for the new force did not go well. It came in April 1980 during\n",
      "the Iranian hostage crisis, when Navy helicopters with Marine pilots flew\n",
      "to a site known as Desert One, some 200 miles southeast of Tehran, to rendezvous\n",
      "with Air Force planes carrying Delta Force commandos and fresh fuel.\n",
      "Mild sandstorms disabled three of the helicopters, and the commander ordered\n",
      "the mission aborted. But foul-ups on the ground resulted in the loss of eight\n",
      "aircraft, five airmen, and three marines. Remembered as “Desert One,”this failure\n",
      "remained vivid for members of the armed forces. It also contributed to the\n",
      "later Goldwater-Nichols reforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1983 came Hezbollah’s massacre of the Marines in Beirut. President Reagan\n",
      "quickly withdrew U.S. forces from Lebanon—a reversal later routinely\n",
      "cited by jihadists as evidence of U.S. weakness. A detailed investigation produced\n",
      "a list of new procedures that would become customary for forces deployed abroad. They involved a number of defensive measures, including caution\n",
      "not only about strange cars and trucks but also about unknown aircraft\n",
      "overhead. “Force protection” became a significant claim on the time and\n",
      "resources of the Department of Defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "A decade later, the military establishment had another experience that\n",
      "evoked both Desert One and the withdrawal from Beirut. The first President\n",
      "Bush had authorized the use of U.S. military forces to ensure humanitarian\n",
      "relief in war-torn Somalia. Tribal factions interfered with the supply missions.\n",
      "By the autumn of 1993, U.S. commanders concluded that the main source of\n",
      "trouble was a warlord, Mohammed Farrah Aidid. An Army special force\n",
      "launched a raid on Mogadishu to capture him. In the course of a long night,\n",
      "two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down, 73 Americans were wounded,\n",
      "18 were killed, and the world’s television screens showed images of an American\n",
      "corpse dragged through the streets by exultant Somalis. Under pressure\n",
      "from Congress, President Clinton soon ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces.\n",
      "“Black Hawk down” joined “Desert One” as a symbol among Americans in\n",

      "preparation, overwhelming force, and a well-defined mission.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1995–1996, the Defense Department began to invest effort in planning\n",
      "how to handle the possibility of a domestic terrorist incident involving\n",
      "weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The idea of a domestic command for\n",
      "homeland defense began to be discussed in 1997, and in 1999 the Joint Chiefs\n",
      "developed a concept for the establishment of a domestic Unified Command.\n",
      "Congress killed the idea. Instead, the Department established the Joint Forces\n",
      "Command, located at Norfolk, Virginia, making it responsible for military\n",

      "Pursuant to the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness Program,\n",
      "the Defense Department began in 1997 to train first responders in 120 of the\n",
      "nation’s largest cities. As a key part of its efforts, Defense created National Guard\n",
      "WMD Civil Support Teams to respond in the event of a WMD terrorist incident.\n",
      "A total of 32 such National Guard teams were authorized by fiscal year\n",
      "2001. Under the command of state governors, they provided support to civilian\n",

      "and coordinate state and local responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Department of Defense, like the Department of State, had a coordinator\n",
      "who represented the department on the interagency committee concerned\n",
      "with counterterrorism. By the end of President Clinton’s first term, this official\n",
      "had become the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and\n",
      "low-intensity conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "The experience of the 1980s had suggested to the military establishment\n",
      "that if it were to have a role in counterterrorism, it would be a traditional military\n",
      "role—to act against state sponsors of terrorism. And the military had what\n",
      "seemed an excellent example of how to do it. In 1986, a bomb went off at a\n",
      "\n",
      "disco in Berlin, killing two American soldiers. Intelligence clearly linked the\n",
      "bombing to Libya’s Colonel Muammar Qadhafi. President Reagan ordered air\n",
      "strikes against Libya. The operation was not cost free: the United States lost two\n",
      "planes. Evidence accumulated later, including the 1988 bombing of Pan Am\n",
      "103, clearly showed that the operation did not curb Qadhafi’s interest in terrorism.\n",
      "However, it was seen at the time as a success. The lesson then taken from\n",
      "Libya was that terrorism could be stopped by the use of U.S. air power that\n",
      "inflicted pain on the authors or sponsors of terrorist acts.\n",
      "This lesson was applied, using Tomahawk missiles, early in the Clinton\n",
      "administration. George H.W. Bush was scheduled to visit Kuwait to be honored\n",
      "for his rescue of that country in the Gulf War of 1991. Kuwaiti security\n",
      "services warned Washington that Iraqi agents were planning to assassinate the\n",
      "former president. President Clinton not only ordered precautions to protect\n",
      "Bush but asked about options for a reprisal against Iraq. The Pentagon proposed\n",
      "12 targets for Tomahawk missiles. Debate in the White House and at the CIA\n",
      "about possible collateral damage pared the list down to three, then to one—\n",
      "Iraqi intelligence headquarters in central Baghdad. The attack was made at\n",
      "night, to minimize civilian casualties. Twenty-three missiles were fired. Other\n",

      "\n",
      "The 1986 attack in Libya and the 1993 attack on Iraq symbolized for the\n",
      "military establishment effective use of military power for counterterrorism—\n",
      "limited retaliation with air power, aimed at deterrence. What remained was the\n",
      "hard question of how deterrence could be effective when the adversary was a\n",
      "loose transnational network.\n",
      "<h3>3.6 AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE</h3>\n",
      "Because coping with terrorism was not (and is not) the sole province of any\n",
      "component of the U.S. government, some coordinating mechanism is necessary.\n",
      "When terrorism was not a prominent issue, the State Department could\n",

      "went by the board: National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski took charge\n",
      "of crisis management.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Reagan administration continued and formalized the practice of having\n",
      "presidential staff coordinate counterterrorism. After the killing of the\n",
      "marines in Beirut, President Reagan signed National Security Directive 138,\n",
      "calling for a “shift . . . from passive to active defense measures” and reprogramming\n",
      "or adding new resources to effect the shift. It directed the State Department\n",
      "“to intensify efforts to achieve cooperation of other governments” and\n",

      "\n",
      "Speaking to the American Bar Association in July 1985, the President characterized\n",

      "Through most of President Reagan’s second term, the coordination of\n",
      "counterterrorism was overseen by a high-level interagency committee chaired\n",

      "First, we will use our new integrated approach to intensify the fight against\n",
      "all forms of terrorism: to capture terrorists, no matter where they hide; to\n",

      "weapons are ever unleashed by a rogue state, a terrorist group, or an\n",
      "international criminal organization. . . . Finally, we must do more to protect\n",
      "our civilian population from biological weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clearly, the President’s concern about terrorism had steadily risen. That\n",
      "heightened worry would become even more obvious early in 1999, when\n",
      "he addressed the National Academy of Sciences and presented his most\n",
      "somber account yet of what could happen if the United States were hit,\n",
      "unprepared, by terrorists wielding either weapons of mass destruction or\n",
      "potent cyberweapons.\n",
      "<h3>3.7 AND IN THE CONGRESS</h3>\n",
      "Since the beginning of the Republic, few debates have been as hotly contested\n",
      "as the one over executive versus legislative powers. At the Constitutional Convention,\n",
      "the founders sought to create a strong executive but check its powers.\n",
      "They left those powers sufficiently ambiguous so that room was left for Congress\n",
      "and the president to struggle over the direction of the nation’s security\n",
      "and foreign policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most serious question has centered on whether or not the president\n",
      "needs congressional authorization to wage war. The current status of that\n",
      "debate seems to have settled into a recognition that a president can deploy military\n",
      "forces for small and limited operations, but needs at least congressional\n",
      "support if not explicit authorization for large and more open-ended military\n",
      "operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "This calculus becomes important in this story as both President Clinton and\n",
      "President Bush chose not to seek a declaration of war on Bin Ladin after he\n",
      "had declared and begun to wage war on us, a declaration that they did not\n",
      "acknowledge publicly. Not until after 9/11 was a congressional authorization\n",
      "sought.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most substantial change in national security oversight in Congress took\n",
      "place following World War II. The Congressional Reorganization Act of 1946\n",
      "created the modern Armed Services committees that have become so powerful\n",
      "today. One especially noteworthy innovation was the creation of the Joint\n",
      "House-Senate Atomic Energy Committee, which is credited by many with the\n",
      "development of our nuclear deterrent capability and was also criticized for\n",
      "wielding too much power relative to the executive branch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironically, this committee was eliminated in the 1970s as Congress was\n",
      "undertaking the next most important reform of oversight in response to the\n",
      "Church and Pike investigations into abuses of power. In 1977, the House and\n",
      "Senate created select committees to exercise oversight of the executive\n",
      "branch’s conduct of intelligence operations.\n",
      "<h4>The Intelligence Committees</h4>\n",
      "The House and Senate select committees on intelligence share some important\n",
      "characteristics. They have limited authorities. They do not have exclusive\n",
      "authority over intelligence agencies. Appropriations are ultimately determined\n",
      "by the Appropriations committees. The Armed Services committees exercise\n",
      "jurisdiction over the intelligence agencies within the Department of Defense\n",
      "(and, in the case of the Senate, over the Central Intelligence Agency). One consequence\n",
      "is that the rise and fall of intelligence budgets are tied directly to\n",
      "trends in defense spending.\n",
      "\n",
      "The president is required by law to ensure the congressional Intelligence\n",
      "committees are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities\n",
      "of the United States. The committees allow the CIA to some extent to withhold\n",
      "information in order to protect sources, methods, and operations. The CIA\n",
      "must bring presidentially authorized covert action Findings and Memoranda\n",
      "of Notification to the Intelligence committees, and it must detail its failures.\n",
      "The committees conduct their most important work in closed hearings or\n",
      "briefings in which security over classified material can be maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Members of the Intelligence committees serve for a limited time, a restriction\n",
      "imposed by each chamber. Many members believe these limits prevent\n",
      "committee members from developing the necessary expertise to conduct effective\n",
      "oversight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secrecy, while necessary, can also harm oversight. The overall budget of the\n",
      "intelligence community is classified, as are most of its activities. Thus, the Intelligence\n",
      "committees cannot take advantage of democracy’s best oversight\n",
      "mechanism: public disclosure. This makes them significantly different from\n",
      "other congressional oversight committees, which are often spurred into action\n",
      "by the work of investigative journalists and watchdog organizations.\n",
      "<h4>Adjusting to the Post–Cold War Era</h4>\n",
      "The unexpected and rapid end of the Cold War in 1991 created trauma in the\n",
      "foreign policy and national security community both in and out of government.\n",
      "While some criticized the intelligence community for failing to forecast\n",
      "the collapse of the Soviet Union (and used this argument to propose drastic\n",
      "cuts in intelligence agencies), most recognized that the good news of being\n",
      "relieved of the substantial burden of maintaining a security structure to meet\n",
      "the Soviet challenge was accompanied by the bad news of increased insecurity.\n",
      "In many directions, the community faced threats and intelligence challenges\n",
      "that it was largely unprepared to meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "So did the intelligence oversight committees. New digitized technologies,\n",
      "and the demand for imagery and continued capability against older systems,\n",
      "meant the need to spend more on satellite systems at the expense of human\n",
      "efforts. In addition, denial and deception became more effective as targets\n",
      "learned from public sources what our intelligence agencies were doing. There\n",
      "were comprehensive reform proposals of the intelligence community, such as\n",
      "those offered by Senators Boren and McCurdy. That said, Congress still took\n",
      "too little action to address institutional weaknesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Cold War over, and the intelligence community roiled by the Ames\n",
      "spy scandal, a presidential commission chaired first by former secretary of\n",
      "defense Les Aspin and later by former secretary of defense Harold Brown examined\n",
      "the intelligence community’s future. After it issued recommendations\n",
      "addressing the DCI’s lack of personnel and budget authority over the intelligence\n",
      "community, the Intelligence committees in 1996 introduced implementing\n",
      "legislation to remedy these problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Department of Defense and its congressional authorizing committees\n",
      "rose in opposition to the proposed changes. The President and DCI did not\n",
      "actively support these changes. Relatively small changes made in 1996 gave the\n",
      "DCI consultative authority and created a new deputy for management and\n",
      "assistant DCIs for collection and analysis. These reforms occurred only after the\n",
      "Senate Select Committee on Intelligence took the unprecedented step of\n",
      "threatening to bring down the defense authorization bill. Indeed, rather than\n",
      "increasing the DCI’s authorities over national intelligence, the 1990s witnessed\n",
      "movement in the opposite direction through, for example, the transfer of the\n",
      "CIA’s imaging analysis capability to the new imagery and mapping agency created\n",
      "within the Department of Defense.\n",
      "<h4>Congress Adjusts</h4>\n",
      "Congress as a whole, like the executive branch, adjusted slowly to the rise of\n",
      "transnational terrorism as a threat to national security. In particular, the growing\n",
      "threat and capabilities of Bin Ladin were not understood in Congress. As the\n",
      "most representative branch of the federal government, Congress closely tracks\n",
      "trends in what public opinion and the electorate identify as key issues. In the\n",
      "years before September 11, terrorism seldom registered as important. To the\n",
      "extent that terrorism did break through and engage the attention of the Congress\n",
      "as a whole, it would briefly command attention after a specific incident,\n",
      "and then return to a lower rung on the public policy agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several points about Congress are worth noting. First, Congress always has\n",
      "a strong orientation toward domestic affairs. It usually takes on foreign policy\n",
      "and national security issues after threats are identified and articulated by the\n",
      "administration. In the absence of such a detailed—and repeated—articulation,\n",
      "national security tends not to rise very high on the list of congressional priorities.\n",
      "Presidents are selective in their use of political capital for international issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the decade before 9/11, presidential discussion of and congressional and\n",
      "public attention to foreign affairs and national security were dominated by\n",
      "other issues—among them, Haiti, Bosnia, Russia, China, Somalia, Kosovo,\n",
      "NATO enlargement, the Middle East peace process, missile defense, and globalization.\n",
      "Terrorism infrequently took center stage; and when it did, the context\n",
      "was often terrorists’ tactics—a chemical, biological, nuclear, or computer\n",
      "threat—not terrorist organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, Congress tends to follow the overall lead of the president on budget\n",
      "issues with respect to national security matters. There are often sharp arguments\n",
      "about individual programs and internal priorities, but by and large the overall\n",
      "funding authorized and appropriated by the Congress comes out close to the\n",
      "president’s request. This tendency was certainly illustrated by the downward\n",
      "trends in spending on defense, intelligence, and foreign affairs in the first part\n",
      "of the 1990s. The White House, to be sure, read the political signals coming\n",
      "from Capitol Hill, but the Congress largely acceded to the executive branch’s\n",
      "funding requests. In the second half of the decade, Congress appropriated some\n",
      "98 percent of what the administration requested for intelligence programs. Apart\n",
      "from the Gingrich supplemental of $1.5 billion for overall intelligence programs\n",
      "in fiscal year 1999, the key decisions on overall allocation of resources\n",
      "for national security issues in the decade before 9/11—including counterterrorism\n",
      "funding—were made in the president’s Office of Management and Budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, Congress did not reorganize itself after the end of the Cold War to\n",
      "address new threats. Recommendations by the Joint Committee on the Organization\n",
      "of Congress were implemented, in part, in the House of Representatives\n",
      "after the 1994 elections, but there was no reorganization of national\n",
      "security functions. The Senate undertook no appreciable changes. Traditional\n",
      "issues—foreign policy, defense, intelligence—continued to be handled by\n",
      "committees whose structure remained largely unaltered, while issues such as\n",
      "transnational terrorism fell between the cracks. Terrorism came under the jurisdiction\n",
      "of at least 14 different committees in the House alone, and budget and\n",
      "oversight functions in the House and Senate concerning terrorism were also\n",
      "splintered badly among committees. Little effort was made to consider an integrated\n",
      "policy toward terrorism, which might range from identifying the threat\n",
      "to addressing vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure; and the piecemeal\n",
      "approach in the Congress contributed to the problems of the executive branch\n",
      "in formulating such a policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, the oversight function of Congress has diminished over time. In\n",
      "recent years, traditional review of the administration of programs and the\n",
      "implementation of laws has been replaced by “a focus on personal investigations,\n",
      "possible scandals, and issues designed to generate media attention.” The\n",
      "unglamorous but essential work of oversight has been neglected, and few members\n",
      "past or present believe it is performed well. DCI Tenet told us:“We ran\n",
      "\n",
      "from threat to threat to threat. . . . here was not a system in place to say,‘You\n",
      "got to go back and do this and this and this.’” Not just the DCI but the entire\n",
      "executive branch needed help from Congress in addressing the questions of\n",
      "counterterrorism strategy and policy, looking past day-to-day concerns. Members\n",
      "of Congress, however, also found their time spent on such everyday matters,\n",
      "or in looking back to investigate mistakes, and often missed the big\n",
      "questions—as did the executive branch. Staff tended as well to focus on\n",
      "parochial considerations, seeking to add or cut funding for individual (often\n",
      "small) programs, instead of emphasizing comprehensive oversight projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth, on certain issues, other priorities pointed Congress in a direction that\n",
      "was unhelpful in meeting the threats that were emerging in the months leading\n",
      "up to 9/11. Committees with oversight responsibility for aviation focused\n",
      "overwhelmingly on airport congestion and the economic health of the airlines,\n",
      "not aviation security. Committees with responsibility for the INS focused on\n",
      "the Southwest border, not on terrorists. Justice Department officials told us that\n",
      "committees with responsibility for the FBI tightly restricted appropriations for\n",
      "improvements in information technology, in part because of concerns about\n",
      "the FBI’s ability to manage such projects. Committees responsible for South\n",
      "Asia spent the decade of the 1990s imposing sanctions on Pakistan, leaving presidents\n",
      "with little leverage to alter Pakistan’s policies before 9/11. Committees\n",
      "with responsibility for the Defense Department paid little heed to developing\n",
      "military responses to terrorism and stymied intelligence reform. All committees\n",
      "found themselves swamped in the minutiae of the budget process, with little\n",
      "time for consideration of longer-term questions, or what many members\n",
      "past and present told us was the proper conduct of oversight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these trends contributed to what can only be described as Congress’s\n",
      "slowness and inadequacy in treating the issue of terrorism in the years\n",
      "before 9/11. The legislative branch adjusted little and did not restructure itself\n",
      "to address changing threats.\n",
      "Its attention to terrorism was episodic and splintered\n",
      "across several committees. Congress gave little guidance to executive\n",
      "branch agencies, did not reform them in any significant way, and did not systematically\n",
      "perform oversight to identify, address, and attempt to resolve the\n",
      "many problems in national security and domestic agencies that became apparent\n",
      "in the aftermath of 9/11.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although individual representatives and senators took significant steps, the\n",
      "overall level of attention in the Congress to the terrorist threat was low. We\n",
      "examined the number of hearings on terrorism from January 1998 to September\n",
      "2001. The Senate Armed Services Committee held nine—four related to\n",
      "the attack on the USS Cole. The House Armed Services Committee also held\n",
      "nine, six of them by a special oversight panel on terrorism. The Senate Foreign\n",
      "Relations Committee and its House counterpart both held four. The Senate\n",
      "Select Committee on Intelligence, in addition to its annual worldwide threat\n",
      "hearing, held eight; its House counterpart held perhaps two exclusively\n",
      "\n",
      "devoted to counter-terrorism, plus the briefings by its terrorist working group.\n",
      "The Senate and House intelligence panels did not raise public and congressional\n",
      "attention on Bin Ladin and al Qaeda prior to the joint inquiry into the attacks\n",
      "of September 11, perhaps in part because of the classified nature of their work.\n",
      "Yet in the context of committees that each hold scores of hearings every year\n",
      "on issues in their jurisdiction, this list is not impressive. Terrorism was a second-\n",
      "or third-order priority within the committees of Congress responsible\n",
      "for national security.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, Congress had a distinct tendency to push questions of emerging\n",
      "national security threats off its own plate, leaving them for others to consider.\n",
      "Congress asked outside commissions to do the work that arguably was at the\n",
      "heart of its own oversight responsibilities.\n",
      "Beginning in 1999, the reports of\n",
      "these commissions made scores of recommendations to address terrorism and\n",

For four days and four nights he remained with the keeper of the legends, who was usually a man selected as tribal historian because of possessing a good memory.

Keep the fire alive and have wood ever ready. See that the drinking olla is never empty. If you do these things well, you will not gad about after you are married and leave your hearth vacant so that your husband may come home to find the fire out or to put it out to your discomfiture; for it is the office of man to kindle the fire but the part of woman to keep it burning.\"\n",

If a girl stumbles and breaks an olla when going for water, her elders take some of the broken pieces and scratch her naked arm. The girls begin to assist in the cooking at 7 or 8 and at 9 or 10 they begin to make baskets. Some are lazy and are allowed to idle away their time, never making more than the single basket required during their puberty ceremonies.\n",

In addition to \"funerals,\" they had parties for which they ground wheat for pinole, though an adult observer would have said that they were grinding up weed seed.
