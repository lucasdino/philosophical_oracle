'''Effective altruism''' ('''EA''') is a 21st-century [[Philosophical movement|philosophical]] and [[social movement]] that advocates impartially calculating benefits and prioritizing causes to provide the greatest good. It is motivated by "using [[Scientific evidence|evidence]] and [[reason]] to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis".<ref name="MacAskill-intro">{{cite journal |last=MacAskill |first=William |date=January 2017 |title=Effective altruism: introduction |url=https://commons.pacificu.edu/eip/vol18/iss1/1 |url-status=live |journal=Essays in Philosophy |language=en |volume=18 |issue=1 |page=eP1580:1–5 |doi=10.7710/1526-0569.1580 |issn=1526-0569 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807105816/https://commons.pacificu.edu/eip/vol18/iss1/1/ |archive-date=2019-08-07 |access-date=2020-02-08|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>The quoted definition is endorsed by a number of organizations at: {{cite web |title=CEA's Guiding Principles |url=https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-guiding-principles |publisher=Centre For Effective Altruism |access-date=2021-12-03}}</ref> People who pursue the goals of effective altruism, who are sometimes called {{em|effective altruists}},<ref>The term ''effective altruists'' is used to refer to people who embrace effective altruism in many published sources such as {{harvtxt|Oliver|2014}}, {{harvtxt|Singer|2015}}, and {{harvtxt|MacAskill|2017}}, though as {{harvtxt|Pummer|MacAskill|2020}} noted, calling people "effective altruists" minimally means that they are engaged in the project of "using evidence and reason to try to find out how to do the most good, and on this basis trying to do the most good", not that they are perfectly effective nor even that they necessarily participate in the effective altruism community.</ref> follow a variety of approaches proposed by the movement, such as donating to selected [[charities]] and choosing careers with the aim of maximizing positive impact. The movement has achieved significant popularity outside of academia, spurring the creation of university-based institutes, [[research centers]], advisory organizations and charities, which, collectively, have donated several hundreds of millions of dollars.{{Sfn|Adams|Crary|Gruen|2023|p=xxii}}

Effective altruists emphasize impartiality and the global [[equal consideration of interests]] when choosing beneficiaries. Popular [[#Cause priorities|cause priorities]] within effective altruism include [[global health]] and [[Economic development|development]], [[Social inequality|social]] and [[economic inequality]], [[animal welfare]], and [[Global catastrophic risks|risks to the survival of humanity]] over the [[Longtermism|long-term future]]. EA has an especially influential status within animal advocacy.{{Sfn|Adams|Crary|Gruen|2023|p=xxii}}

The movement developed during the 2000s, and the name {{em|effective altruism}} was coined in 2011. Philosophers influential to the movement include [[Peter Singer]], [[Toby Ord]], and [[William MacAskill]]. What began as a set of evaluation techniques advocated by a diffuse coalition evolved into an identity.<ref name="reluctant-prophet" /> Effective altruism has strong ties to the elite universities in the United States and Britain, and [[Silicon Valley]] has become a key centre for the "[[longtermist]]" submovement, with a tight subculture there.<ref name="Tiku2022">{{cite news |last=Tiku |first=Nitasha |date=2022-11-17 |title=The do-gooder movement that shielded Sam Bankman-Fried from scrutiny |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/17/effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto/ |access-date=2022-11-25 |newspaper=The Washington Post |language=en-US}}</ref>

The movement received mainstream attention and criticism with the [[bankruptcy of FTX|bankruptcy of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX]] as founder [[Sam Bankman-Fried]] was a major funder of effective altruism causes prior to late 2022. Some in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] criticized what they described as a culture of sexual misconduct.

(p.&nbsp;vii)</ref> and those who only try do the most good they can within a defined budget.<ref name="MacAskill-definition" />{{rp|15}}

According to MacAskill, the view of effective altruism as doing the most good one can within a defined budget can be compatible with a wide variety of views on [[morality]] and [[meta-ethics]], as well as traditional religious teachings on altruism such as in [[Christianity]].<ref name="MacAskill-intro" /><ref name="EA-IEE" /> Effective altruism can also be in tension with religion where religion emphasizes spending resources on worship and evangelism instead of causes that do the most good.<ref name="MacAskill-intro" />

Other than Peter Singer and William MacAskill, philosophers associated with effective altruism include [[Nick Bostrom]],<ref name=Matthews2015>{{Cite web |last=Matthews |first=Dylan |date=2015-08-10 |title=I spent a weekend at Google talking with nerds about charity.

===Impartiality===
{{See also|Equal consideration of interests}}

Effective altruism aims to emphasize impartial reasoning in that everyone's [[well-being]] counts equally.<ref>{{harvnb|Singer|2015|pp=85–95}}; {{harvnb|MacAskill|2019a|pp=17–19}}; {{harvnb|Pummer|MacAskill|2020}}.</ref> Singer, in his 1972 essay "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]",<ref name=SingerInfluence>On the influence of Singer's essay "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]" see, for example: {{harvnb|Snow|2015}}, {{harvnb|Singer|2015|pp=13–20}}, and {{cite magazine |last=Lichtenberg |first=Judith |date=November 30, 2015 |title=Peter Singer's extremely altruistic heirs: Forty years after it was written, 'Famine, Affluence, and Morality' has spawned a radical new movement |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/124690/peter-singers-extremely-altruistic-heirs |magazine=[[The New Republic]]}} Singer's arguments for impartiality were later repeated in other books by him (such as {{harvnb|Singer|2009}}, {{harvnb|Singer|2015}}).</ref> wrote:

Impartiality combined with seeking to do the most good leads to prioritizing benefits to those who are in a worse state, because anyone who happens to be worse off will benefit more from an improvement in their state, all other things being equal.<ref name="EA-IEE"/><ref name=principles/>

====Scope of moral consideration====
One issue related to moral impartiality is the question of which beings are deserving of moral consideration. Some effective altruists consider the well-being of non-human animals in addition to humans, and advocate for animal welfare issues such as ending [[factory farming]].<ref>{{multiref2 | {{cite journal |last=Fisher |first=Andrew |date=January 2017 |title=Theory-neutral arguments for 'effective animal advocacy' |url=https://commons.pacificu.edu/eip/vol18/iss1/3 |url-status=live |journal=Essays in Philosophy |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=eP1578:1–14 |doi=10.7710/1526-0569.1578 |issn=1526-0569 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807105844/https://commons.pacificu.edu/eip/vol18/iss1/3/ |archive-date=2019-08-07 |access-date=2020-02-08|doi-access=free }} | {{cite journal |last=Broad |first=Garrett M. |date=December 2018 |title=Effective animal advocacy: effective altruism, the social economy, and the animal protection movement |journal=Agriculture and Human Values |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=777–789 |doi=10.1007/s10460-018-9873-5 |s2cid=158634567}} }}</ref> Those who subscribe to [[longtermism]] include [[future generations]] as possible beneficiaries and try to improve the moral value of the long-term future by, for example, reducing [[existential risks]].<ref name="Singer2015" />{{rp|165–178}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Beckstead |first=Nick |title=Effective Altruism: Philosophical Issues |date=2019 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780198841364 |editor1-last=Greaves |editor1-first=Hilary |editor1-link=Hilary Greaves |series=Engaging philosophy |location=Oxford, England; New York |pages=80–98 |chapter=A brief argument for the overwhelming importance of shaping the far future |doi=10.1093/oso/9780198841364.003.0006 |oclc=1101772304 |editor2-last=Pummer |editor2-first=Theron}}</ref>

====Criticism of impartiality====
The [[drowning child analogy]] in Singer's essay provoked philosophical debate. In response to a version of Singer's drowning child analogy,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zwolinski |first1=Matt |title=Why Wouldn't You Save a Drowning Child? |url=https://fee.org/articles/why-wouldnt-you-save-a-drowning-child/ |website=[[Foundation for Economic Education]] |language=en |date=24 August 2015}}</ref> philosopher [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] in 2006 asked whether the most effective action of a man in an expensive suit, confronted with a drowning child, would not be to save the child and ruin his suit—but rather, sell the suit and donate the proceeds to charity.<ref name=Appiah2006>{{cite book |last=Appiah |first=Kwame Anthony |author-link=Kwame Anthony Appiah |date=2006 |title=Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers |series=Issues of Our Time |location=New York |publisher=[[W.

William Schambra has criticized the impartial logic of effective altruism, arguing that benevolence arising from [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] and face-to-face interactions is stronger and more prevalent than charity based on impartial, detached altruism.<ref name="Schambra"/> Such community-based charitable giving, he wrote, is foundational to [[civil society]] and, in turn, [[democracy]].<ref name="Schambra">{{cite web |last=Schambra |first=William A. |date=May 22, 2014 |title=Opinion: The coming showdown between philanthrolocalism and effective altruism |url=https://www.philanthropydaily.com/the-coming-showdown-between-philanthrolocalism-and-effective-altruism/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205205424/https://www.philanthropydaily.com/the-coming-showdown-between-philanthrolocalism-and-effective-altruism/ |archive-date=February 5, 2020 |access-date=February 5, 2020 |website=Philanthropy Daily }}</ref> [[Larissa MacFarquhar]] said that people have diverse moral emotions, and she suggested that some effective altruists are not unemotional and detached but feel as much empathy for distant strangers as for people nearby.<ref>{{cite web |last=MacFarquhar |first=Larissa |author-link=Larissa MacFarquhar |date=July 1, 2015 |url=https://www.bostonreview.net/forum_response/response-larissa-macfarquhar/ |title=Forum Response: Response to Effective Altruism: Altruism at a distance need not require choosing logic over empathy |website=[[Boston Review]]}}</ref> Richard Pettigrew concurred that many effective altruists "feel more profound dismay at the suffering of people unknown to them than many people feel", and he argued that impartiality in EA need not be dispassionate and "is not obviously in tension with much in [[care ethics]]" as some philosophers have argued.<ref name=Pettigrew2023 /> [[Ross Douthat]] of ''The New York Times'' criticized the movement's {{" '}}telescopic philanthropy' aimed at distant populations" and envisioned "effective altruists sitting around in a San Francisco skyscraper calculating how to relieve suffering halfway around the world while the city decays beneath them", while he also praised the movement for providing "useful rebukes to the solipsism and anti-human pessimism that haunts the developed world today".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Douthat |first1=Ross |title=Opinion {{!}} The Case for a Less-Effective Altruism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/opinion/effective-altruism.html |access-date=19 December 2022 |work=The New York Times |date=18 November 2022}}</ref>

===Cause prioritization===
A key component of effective altruism is "cause prioritization". Cause prioritization is based on the principle of cause ''neutrality'', the idea that resources should be distributed to causes based on what will do the most good, irrespective of the identity of the beneficiary and the way in which they are helped.<ref name="EA-IEE" /> By contrast, many non-profits emphasize effectiveness and evidence with respect to a single cause such as education or climate change.<ref name="Schambra"/>

One tool that EA-based organizations may use to prioritize cause areas is the {{em|importance, tractability, and neglectedness}} framework. Importance is the amount of value that would be created if a problem were solved, tractability is the fraction of a problem that would be solved if additional resources were devoted to it, and neglectedness is the quantity of resources already committed to a cause.<ref name="reluctant-prophet">{{Cite magazine| issn = 0028-792X| last = Lewis-Kraus| first = Gideon| title = The Reluctant Prophet of Effective Altruism| magazine = The New Yorker| access-date = 2022-12-04| date = 2022-08-08| url = https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/the-reluctant-prophet-of-effective-altruism}}</ref>

The information required for cause prioritization may involve [[data analysis]], comparing possible outcomes with what would have happened under other conditions ([[#Counterfactual reasoning|counterfactual reasoning]]), and identifying [[uncertainty]].<ref name="EA-IEE" /><ref>{{cite journal |last=MacAskill |first=William |author-link=William MacAskill |date=September 2019b |title=Practical ethics given moral uncertainty |url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:f3da6f54-8017-432a-a294-7d7707e6a74d |url-status=live |journal=[[Utilitas]] |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=231–245 |doi=10.1017/S0953820819000013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215082736/https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:f3da6f54-8017-432a-a294-7d7707e6a74d |archive-date=2021-02-15 |access-date=2020-09-19 |s2cid=150859616}}</ref> The difficulty of these tasks has led to the creation of organizations that specialize in researching the relative prioritization of causes.<ref name="EA-IEE" />

====Criticism of cause prioritization====
This practice of "weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another" was criticized by Ken Berger and Robert Penna of [[Charity Navigator]] for being "moralistic, in the worst sense of the word" and "elitist".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism|title=The Elitist Philanthropy of So-Called Effective Altruism|last1=Berger|first1=Ken|last2=Penna|first2=Robert|date=November 25, 2013|magazine=[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]|access-date=2021-12-05|archive-date=2021-12-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211203014448/https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism|url-status=live}}</ref> William MacAskill responded to Berger and Penna, defending the rationale for comparing one beneficiary's interests against another and concluding that such comparison is difficult and sometimes impossible but often necessary.<ref name=MacAskill2013>{{cite magazine|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/what_charity_navigator_gets_wrong_about_effective_altruism|title=What Charity Navigator Gets Wrong About Effective Altruism|last=MacAskill|first=William|date=December 3, 2013|magazine=[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]|access-date=2021-12-05|archive-date=2021-12-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211203054941/https://ssir.org/articles/entry/what_charity_navigator_gets_wrong_about_effective_altruism|url-status=live}}</ref> MacAskill argued that the more pernicious form of elitism was that of donating to art galleries (and like institutions) instead of charity.<ref name=MacAskill2013/> Ian David Moss suggested that the criticism of cause prioritization could be resolved by what he called "domain-specific effective altruism", which would encourage "that principles of effective altruism be followed within an area of philanthropic focus, such as a specific cause or geography" and could resolve the conflict between local and global perspectives for some donors.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Moss |first1=Ian David |date=Spring 2017 |title=In Defense of Pet Causes |url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/in_defense_of_pet_causes |magazine=[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]] |access-date=19 December 2022 |language=en-us}}</ref>

===Cost-effectiveness===
Some charities are considered to be far more effective than others, as charities may spend different amounts of money to achieve the same goal, and some charities may not achieve the goal at all.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Thompson |first=Derek |date=2015-06-15 |title=The Most Efficient Way to Save a Life |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/what-is-the-greatest-good/395768/ |access-date=2023-04-20 |website=The Atlantic |language=en}}</ref> Effective altruists seek to identify interventions that are highly cost-effective in [[expected value|expectation]]. Many interventions have [[Uncertainty|uncertain]] benefits, and the expected value of one intervention can be higher than that of another if its benefits are larger, even if it has a smaller chance of succeeding.<ref name="Thompson2015" /> One metric effective altruists use to choose between health interventions is the estimated number of [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALY) added per dollar.<ref name="reluctant-prophet"/>

===Counterfactual reasoning===
[[Counterfactual conditional|Counterfactual]] reasoning involves considering the possible outcomes of alternative choices. It has been employed by effective altruists in a number of contexts, including career choice. Many people assume that the best way to help others is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rosato |first1=Donna |last2=Wong |first2=Grace |date=November 2011 |title=Best jobs for saving the world |work=CNN |url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/best-jobs/2011/jobs-helping-others/1.html |url-status=live |access-date=February 28, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303191753/https://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/best-jobs/2011/jobs-helping-others/1.html |archive-date=March 3, 2013}}</ref> However, since there is a high supply of candidates for such positions, it makes sense to compare the amount of good one candidate does to how much good the next-best candidate would do. According to this reasoning, the marginal impact of a career is likely to be smaller than the gross impact.<ref name="todd-career-paper">{{cite journal |last1=Todd |first1=Benjamin |title=Which Ethical Careers Make a Difference?: The Replaceability Issue in the Ethics of Career Choice |url=https://www.academia.edu/1807196 |url-status=live |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215082734/https://www.academia.edu/1807196/Which_Ethical_Careers_Make_a_Difference_The_Replaceability_Issue_in_the_Ethics_of_Career_Choice |archive-date=February 15, 2021 |access-date=March 11, 2017 |website=University of Oxford}}</ref>

===Differences from utilitarianism===
Although EA aims for [[Utility maximization problem|maximizing]] like [[utilitarianism]], EA differs from utilitarianism in a few ways; for example, EA does not claim that people should always maximize the good [[The end justifies the means|regardless of the means]], and EA does not claim that the good is the sum total of [[well-being]].<ref name=utilitarianism/> Toby Ord has described utilitarians as "number-crunching", compared with most effective altruists whom he called "guided by conventional wisdom tempered by an eye to the numbers".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sandbu|first=Martin|date=December 29, 2023|url=https://www.ft.com/content/128f3a15-b048-4741-b3e0-61c9346c390b|title=Effective altruism was the favoured creed of Sam Bankman-Fried. Can it survive his fall?|website=Financial Times}}</ref> Other philosophers have argued that EA still retains some core ethical commitments that are essential and distinctive to utilitarianism, such as the principle of impartiality, [[welfarism]] and good-maximization.{{Sfn|Adams|Crary|Gruen|2023|p=xxvi}}

MacAskill has argued that one shouldn't be absolutely certain about which ethical view is correct, and that "when we are morally uncertain, we should act in a way that serves as a best compromise between different moral views".<ref name="MacAskill2022" /> He also wrote that even from a purely [[consequentialist]] perspective, "naive calculations that justify some harmful action because it has good consequences are, in practice, almost never correct".<ref name="MacAskill2022" />

==Cause priorities==

The principles and goals of effective altruism are wide enough to support furthering any cause that allows people to do the most good, while taking into account cause neutrality.<ref name="practical-ethics" /> Many people in the effective altruism movement have prioritized global health and development, animal welfare, and mitigating risks that threaten the future of humanity.<ref name="vox" /><ref name="skelton" />

===Global health and development===
The alleviation of [[global poverty]] and [[neglected tropical diseases]] has been a focus of some of the earliest and most prominent organizations associated with effective altruism.

===Long-term future and global catastrophic risks===

The ethical stance of [[longtermism]], emphasizing the importance of positively influencing the long-term future, developed closely in relation to effective altruism.<ref>{{Cite web |last=MacAskill |first=William |date=2022-08-07 |title=What is longtermism? |url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220805-what-is-longtermism-and-why-does-it-matter |access-date=2022-09-15 |website=[[BBC]] |language=en}}</ref><ref name="case-for-longtermism">{{Cite news |last=MacAskill |first=William |date=2022-08-05 |title=Opinion {{!}} The Case for Longtermism |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/opinion/the-case-for-longtermism.html |access-date=2022-09-15 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Longtermism argues that "distance in time is like distance in space", suggesting that the welfare of future individuals matters as much as the welfare of currently existing individuals.

[[Existential risk]]s, such as dangers associated with [[biotechnology]] and [[Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|advanced artificial intelligence]], are often highlighted and the subject of active research.<ref name="case-for-longtermism"/> Existential risks have such huge impacts that achieving a very small change in such a risk—say a 0.0001-percent reduction—"might be worth more than saving a billion people today", reported Gideon Lewis-Kraus in 2022, but he added that nobody in the EA community openly endorses such an extreme conclusion.<ref name="reluctant-prophet" />

Organizations that work actively on research and advocacy for improving the long-term future, and have connections with the effective altruism community, are the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] at the University of Oxford, the [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]] at the University of Cambridge, and the [[Future of Life Institute]].<ref name="guan-op-ed">{{cite news|last1=Guan|first1=Melody|title=The New Social Movement of our Generation: Effective Altruism|url=https://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/new-social-movement-generation-effective-altruism/|access-date=11 March 2017|work=Harvard Political Review|date=19 April 2015|archive-date=12 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312073154/https://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/new-social-movement-generation-effective-altruism/|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] is focused on the more narrow mission of [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence#Mitigation|managing advanced artificial intelligence]].<ref>{{multiref2 | {{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment|title=The case for taking AI seriously as a threat to humanity|last=Piper|first=Kelsey|date=2018-12-21|website=Vox|access-date=2019-01-12|archive-date=2019-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113062721/https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment|url-status=live}} | {{cite news|last1=Basulto|first1=Dominic|title=The very best ideas for preventing artificial intelligence from wrecking the planet|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/07/07/the-very-best-ideas-for-preventing-artificial-intelligence-from-wrecking-the-planet/|access-date=March 11, 2017|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 7, 2015|archive-date=March 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316074301/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/07/07/the-very-best-ideas-for-preventing-artificial-intelligence-from-wrecking-the-planet/|url-status=live}} }}</ref>

== Approaches ==
Effective altruists pursue different approaches to doing good, such as donating to effective charitable organizations, using their career to make more money for donations or directly contributing their labor, and starting new non-profit or for-profit ventures.

=== Donation ===

====Financial donation====
Many effective altruists engage in charitable [[donation]]. Some believe it is a moral duty to alleviate [[suffering]] through donations if other possible uses of those funds do not offer comparable benefits to oneself.<ref name="Singer1972" /> Some lead a [[frugality|frugal lifestyle]] in order to donate more.<ref name="kaufman-wise">"Living modestly to give more", in {{harvnb|Singer|2015|pp=23–37}}; {{cite news |last1=Burton |first1=Paul |date=October 13, 2015 |title=Family Gives Away Half Their Income To Help Others |work=[[WBZ-TV]] |url=https://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/10/13/family-gives-away-half-their-income-to-help-others/ |url-status=live |access-date=March 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930185608/https://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/10/13/family-gives-away-half-their-income-to-help-others/ |archive-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref>

Giving What We Can (GWWC) is an organization whose members pledge to donate at least 10% of their future income to the causes that they believe are the most effective. GWWC was founded in 2009 by Toby Ord, who lives on £18,000 ($27,000) per year and donates the balance of his income.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11950843|title=Toby Ord: Why I'm giving £1m to charity|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom|date=December 13, 2010|access-date=March 2, 2013|newspaper=BBC News|archive-date=May 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513221027/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11950843|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2020, Ord said that people had donated over $100 million to date through the GWWC pledge.<ref>{{cite web |last=Matthews |first=Dylan |date=30 November 2020 |title=Toby Ord explains his pledge to give 10% of his pay to charity |url=https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21728925/charity-10-percent-tithe-giving-what-we-can-toby-ord |website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |access-date=2021-12-06}}</ref>

[[Founders Pledge]] is a similar initiative, founded out of the non-profit Founders Forum for Good, whereby entrepreneurs make a legally binding commitment to donate a percentage of their personal proceeds to charity in the event that they sell their business.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shead |first=Sam |title=Facebook's little-known billionaire cofounder is funding a London charity |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-cofounder-dustin-moskovitz-is-funding-founders-pledge-2017-3 |access-date=2024-05-12 |website=Business Insider |language=en-US}}</ref> As of April 2024, nearly 1,900 entrepreneurs had pledged around $10 billion and nearly $1.1 billion had been donated.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home |url=https://founderspledge.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240405170713/https://www.founderspledge.com/ |archive-date=2024-04-05 |access-date=2023-04-12 |website=Founders Pledge}}</ref>

====Organ donation====
EA has been used to argue that humans should [[organ donation|donate organ]]s, whilst alive or after death, and some effective altruists do.<ref>{{harvnb|Singer|2015|pp=4, 14, 67–72, 100–101}}; {{cite journal|title=Effective altruists ought to be allowed to sell their kidneys|first=Ryan|last=Tonkens|date=March 2018|journal=[[Bioethics (journal)|Bioethics]]|volume=32|issue=3|pages=147–154|doi=10.1111/bioe.12427|pmid=29369383}}</ref>

=== Founding effective organizations ===

Some effective altruists start non-profit or for-profit organizations to implement [[cost-effective]] ways of doing good. On the non-profit side, for example, [[Michael Kremer]] and [[Rachel Glennerster]] conducted [[randomized controlled trial]]s in Kenya to find out the best way to improve students' test scores.
