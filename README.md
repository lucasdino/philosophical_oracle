Hello!   

This is a project for Statistical Natural Language Processing (CSE 256) at UCSD - but this has been a project of mine that I've wanted to complete for awhile.

The idea -- how can we properly interpret and embed philosophical and religious texts to analyze how they differ? From this, could we build a way for someone to upload their journal entry (or some piece of writing that has philosophical density) to categorize someone's beliefs? From this, you could recommend specific texts that are most similar to your personal philosophy -- or even recommend very different concepts to expand your worldview.
