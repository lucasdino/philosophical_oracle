The question of why and how we are supposed to live has been contemplated for centuries.  Absurdist Albert Camus wrote that life is like the Sisyphean task of pushing a boulder up a mountain for all of eternity. Existence itself, in other words, is persevering. Camus writes, “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”  So, how do we persevere well? How do we persevere happily?

Accept your fate

As mentioned before, hardship allows you to show your true character. So, embrace hardship. Amor Fati. Love your fate. Embrace every single moment, even moments of hell. 

The chance of us existing is small, but here we are. The chances of that particular sperm fertilizing that particular egg were small. But here you are. You have already beaten seemingly insurmountable odds. Your existence is rare and beautiful. So, even our suffering is rare and beautiful. 

Accepting your fate does not mean you’re necessarily okay with bad things happening to you. It means you are accepting that struggling is a part of existing. We can use this to persevere because this gives us the courage to act. Loving and appreciating every minute shows us that we are not helpless. We are just experiencing what it means to exist. 

Don’t complain 

Either you persevere or you don’t. Regardless, complaining does not necessarily tip the odds in your favor. Yes, feel emotions. Yes, confide in people. But do not tell yourself you will fail. Do not tell anyone else you will fail. Don’t tell anyone that this specific struggle will be the end of you. 

Complaining, in fact, makes it harder to endure. Marcus argues that you can endure anything by thinking it’s endurable. If you allow yourself to complain, you’re defeating yourself. 

You may be able to get through something by complaining. But, that will not leave your good nature intact. To exercise virtue in the face of adversity, we must have control over our own minds. 

Realize it’s not the end of the world

Way harsh, but there’s still a lesson here. he urges us to not take things personally. Things are not taken from you, but returned. After all, the entire universe existed before us and will exist after us. 

Likewise, we existed before our current struggle and will exist after it. 

In the final episode of Bojack Horseman, Bojack says, “Life’s a bitch and then you die, right?” Diane responds, “Sometimes. Sometimes life’s a bitch and then you keep living.” We live despite and in spite of how much life sucks. Life won’t always be suffering, but life is contingent on suffering. When we lose an opportunity, a loved one, or when life is just bad, the best thing to do is live virtuously no matter what. 

This difficulty will end. You will end. We can only control our response to that. 

Don’t just sit there and take it 

he is reminding us that we have some control over our lives. By putting off action, we are allowing our suffering to have full control. 

By working towards ending our suffering, we are regaining control. Persevering is active. We don’t persevere by shutting down until it’s over. 

We persevere by responding rationally to our hardships. We persevere by determining the most virtuous course of action. Persevere immediately. 

Demand better, don’t just want better 

When we are struggling, we may want to give up on ourselves. We may settle. We may get used to things being okay and give up on striving for a good life. This is unacceptable. 

Like we said, you can either persevere or stop. Either way, we are dying at some point. As he says, we can die ordinary if we choose to not persevere. Everything ends at some point, but there is power in the choice to persevere. A hardship can either end because we act to make it end or we die. We have some control over when our suffering ends. 

We must demand that we get through this hardship. Clean your room a little. Ask for better treatment. Advocate for yourself and take care of yourself. We cannot get used to suffering. We can accept the existence of suffering, but we still have to fight against it. Do not become complacent. 

Stop torturing yourself 

Perhaps our suffering is mostly self-inflicted. When difficulties arise, we sometimes take it personally. It’s important to take accountability for actions that cause suffering, but you can do that without suffering.

Instead of saying, “I lost my job because I’m lazy and stupid,” you can say, “I lost my job because I did not meet the requirements for it.”  The difference between those two sentences is that one is reporting a judgment and the other is reporting a fact. We suffer less when we rationally map why things happen.

Calling ourselves stupid for letting something happen does not solve the problem and makes us feel worse. Shit usually happens purely because shit happens. Taking it personally makes it harder to actively solve the problem. Recognizing that it is not 100% our fault can give us the courage to act. 

Use your resources

We enter fight or flight mode when it gets tough. However, the good thing about being humans is that we have the ability to be rational. 

Don’t go into survival mode. Take a breath and remember you have the opportunity to outwardly show your virtue. Not everything needs a reaction. Moreover, not everything needs an immediate reaction. 

While persevering is active, you can still take time to decide what to do. You do not need to react immediately unless it’s life or death. Let it stew.

Money Doesn’t Make You Rich

Look at any millionaire, he tells Lucilius in one of his letters, they are some of the poorest people in Rome. Money has made them obsess over public opinion. Money has control of their schedules and their decisions. Money has put them in the center of a circle of sycophants and grifters. Money has escalated their tastes and expectations beyond quenching.

“These individuals,” he writes, “have riches just as we say that we ‘have a fever,’ when really the fever has us.” It’s a sad sight, he says.

What’s sadder is that the look-at-any-millionaire experiment still works today—a lot of rich people in this world live very poor lives. They’re rarely not thinking about money. About how to acquire more and of it, about what they can trade of their life in exchange for it, about who they know who has more of it than they do. These poor souls know they have a lot of money, but what they don’t understand is that, really, money has a lot of them.

“Money never made a man rich,” he adds, “Do you ask the reason for this? He who possesses more begins to be able to possess still more.” This is a universal human battle. It doesn’t really matter the number in your bank account, it is hard to turn off the brain’s desire for more. Until you can turn it off, until you have a sense for what is enough, you are poorer than the poorest people in Rome.

“[H]e who has enough,” he writes, “has attained that which never fell to the rich man’s lot—a stopping-point.”

Define What Wealth Means To You

If Ramit Sethi didn’t beat us to it, we might have named the Wealth Course, “The Rich Life.”

Ramit is the bestselling author of I Will Teach You To Be Rich and host of the I Will Teach You To Be Rich podcast (one of Ryan’s favorite podcasts), and of the Netflix series How to Get Rich. His work focuses on how to help people live what he calls “The Rich Life.”

The title is a bit misleading because he doesn’t use “rich” solely in a monetary wealth way. It’s more an all-encompassing philosophy about living a good life. Ramit talks and writes about entrepreneurship, spending, investing, social skills, fitness, psychology, productivity, and on and on—all these interconnected components that go into living well.

Key to Ramit’s work is the idea that the definition of The Rich Life varies from person to person. When we interviewed him a while back, he gave this example:

Ramit, on the other hand, doesn’t really care about flowers. So his Rich Life looks different. His definition of a rich life, he says, is never having to step into a Home Depot.

The point is, everyone’s different. Therefore, everyone’s definition of wealth is different. We live in a world that constantly bombards us with messages about what a rich life is supposed to look like. We see pictures of lavish vacations, designer clothing, expensive cars, and luxurious homes. We are told that having more money, more possessions, and more status is the key to happiness and fulfillment.

But the truth is the Rich Life means something different for everyone. What makes one person feel rich may not do the same for another.

This is why it’s essential to figure out your definition of the Rich Life.

Know What Enough Is

he said this is what it means to be poor: wanting more than you have.

Consider, he says, the person who has or wants the nicest stuff—the furniture with gold trim, the silverware made by ancient artists, a team of butlers, jewelry from every part of the globe. “Though he should pile up all of these,” he writes, “never will they satisfy his insatiable mind…This is not a thirst, but a sickness. And it is not merely money or food that leads to this result; the same nature is to be found in every desire that derives, not from need, but from vice: all that you pile up to satisfy it will not terminate but advance desire.”

That’s the irony of material riches. It’s a series of moving goal posts. You think having X will be sufficient only to find that 2x is better and that 3x is preferable still.

“Prosperity is a restless thing: it troubles itself,” he says elsewhere. Or rather, it propels itself.

See if you can find one millionaire who isn’t trying to become a billionaire. See if you can find one billionaire who doesn’t check the Forbes list every year and glare jealously at the names above them.

That’s what getting rich does to us. It rarely gives us a sense of “enough.” Instead, it gives us a sense of how much more there could be.

Needless to say this is a path to bankruptcy, mentally and emotionally if not financially. It’s a hedonic treadmill that eventually breaks down…or breaks the person frantically running atop it.

They would try to caution us from ever getting on, or to get off while we still can.

There is a story Ryan Holiday writes about in Stillness is the Key. Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller, the authors of Slaughterhouse Five and Catch-22, respectively, were once at a fancy party in New York. As they stood in the home of some billionaire, Vonnegut needled his friend.

“Joe,” he said, “how does it feel that our host only yesterday may have made more money than your novel has earned in its entire history?”

“I’ve got something he can never have,” Heller replied.

“And what on earth could that be?” Vonnegut asked.

“The knowledge that I’ve got enough.”

Knowing what is enough. Living in a place of fullness rather than of craving. That, they would say, is a wealthy person. That is someone whose life is one of abundance.

What Is Regret?

After a long day at work and terrible traffic, you finally make it home. The stress has taken its toll, and you’re exhausted, bored, and frustrated with the day’s events all at once. You walk into your kitchen to find a heaping pile of dishes–something you asked your spouse to take care of this morning! Yet, they’re relaxing in front of the TV as if nothing’s wrong.

You feel the anger rising up, and unable to control yourself, you yell at your spouse. You don’t hold back. You’re out to make a point, to prove that what happened is a really big deal.

Your spouse is frightened and embarrassed. They’re worried–you’ve never yelled at them like this before. They were going to do the dishes later, but you never gave them that opportunity. The day’s been long for them too, yet you didn’t care. They just wanted to have a nice night with you, but now that’s ruined.

Later that night, you finally start to understand what losing your temper has cost you. You know you shouldn’t have said what you said. You should have been more considerate. You should have acted differently–you regret your choices.

Maybe for you it wasn’t a pile of dishes that set you off. Maybe it was your kids using markers on the wall. Or your boss dumping that report on you before your vacation. Regardless of the scenario, we’ve all lost it at some point, and we’ve all felt the pang of regret. 

They would define regret as the moment when past events consume our present lives. When we dwell over things we have no control over. When we resist our fate. he argued that we must be “satisfied with what [we] have, and accept the present–all of it.” Regret is the contrary–when we’re not satisfied with what we have, when we reject what we’ve been given.

he said “we often suffer more in imagination than in reality.” He was saying that regret is no more than an emotion of our imagination. We believe that had we said something (or held our tongue), had we acted differently, the outcome would have been different. 

he carried a similar mindset, and provided a solution to this problem. “External things are not the problem. It is your assessment of them. Which you can erase right now.” 

Let’s take another look at that “fight” you had with your spouse. Your regrets are not about the actual dishes or your spouse–it’s about your perception of expectations. You expected your spouse to have the dishes done when you got home. So you believe it should have been different, and had it been different, you would be better off. 

So does that mean it’s your spouse’s fault? Maybe for leaving the dishes in the sink. But certainly not for your overreaction. And definitely not for the regret you felt later that night. Regret is an internal problem, to be both diagnosed and treated by ourselves. We must learn to look past these “self-focused emotions” and master our feelings of regret. This post aims to help you understand your emotions, use the past to your advantage, and conquer your biggest regrets.

Why Do I Feel Regret?
“Life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future” – he 

We’ve all told ourselves, “no regrets.” There are countless memes, inspirational quotes, and videos reminding us online. Poets, singers, painters, and writers have been creating art about it for millenia.  We’ve practically been conditioned to live by it.

But no matter how many times we read about it, sing along to a song about it, or tell ourselves not to, we all have something we regret. We all have that nagging feeling that comes back to us. That hits us exactly when we thought we forgot about that time, that place, those people. It comes back at the very worst time. It sucks. It hurts.

The power of regret is not to be understated. Bestselling author and founder of the American Regret Project Daniel Pink found that 82 percent of Americans experience regret at least occasionally. Pink describes regret as “an indispensable emotion,” yet also claims it can be “a positive instrument for improving your life.”

If we truly want to improve our life, we can’t run away from these negative feelings. We can’t hide them. But should we just accept this despair? Should we just come to terms living with regret?

This is what the great writer Samuel Johnson must have been wondering near the end of 1775. With 1776 on the horizon, Johnson wrote in his diary:

“When I look back on resolutions of improvement and amendment which have year after year been made and broken, either by negligence, forgetfulness, vicious idleness, casual interruption, or morbid infirmity; when I find that so much of my life has been stolen unprofitably away, and that I can descry by retrospection scarcely a few single days properly and vigorously employed, why do I yet try to resolve again? I try because reformation is necessary and despair is criminal.”

Johnson came to terms with his past, but not with his regret. He chose to reflect upon his hardships in order to better himself, to avoid making those same mistakes in the future. He chose to fight regret–not to wallow in it.

If there’s one thing we can learn from Johnson, it must be that experiencing regret is inevitable–but our actions and our mindset are not. Thus, the question is not ‘Why do I feel regret?’, but rather ‘How do I deal with it?’ ‘How do I move on?’ ‘How can I make myself better because of this?’ In order to answer these questions, they practiced the following strategies to help them build their mental toughness and resilience–starting with examining what they controlled.

Focus On What You Control
“Every event has two handles, one by which it can be carried, and one by which it can’t. If your brother does you wrong, don’t grab it by his wronging, because this is the handle incapable of lifting it. Instead, use the other—that he is your brother, that you were raised together, and then you will have hold of the handle that carries.” – he

One of the most important practices in philosophy, which was introduced by he, is determining what we control and what we don’t. What we have power over and what we don’t. What we can change and what we can’t.

There are two ways in which we can look at the past–two handles we can grab, to use he’ quote. The first handle forces us to perceive the past as an inevitable experience, destined to wrong and hurt us from the beginning. The opposite handle, however, allows us to extract the good parts, and use our experiences to benefit ourselves. 

In looking at past decisions, we must grab them by the latter handle. We must understand that what happened, happened. We must see that we can’t change the past, no matter how much it hurt us or someone else. So what good does regret do?

Absolutely nothing, as Holocaust survivor and author Dr. Edith Eger explained to Ryan Holiday on an episode of The Podcast. Ryan was discussing a relationship he regretted messing up, and Dr. Eger offered him one gift that would solve the guilt right then. “I give you a sentence,” she said, “One sentence—if I knew then what I know now, I would have done things differently.” That’s the end of that, she said. “Guilt is in the past, and the one thing you cannot change is the past.” 

As a society we’ve become disillusioned by the idea of what we control. We all believe we have some control over the outcome of whatever we encounter. We all believe that if we keep thinking about what happened, somehow we’ll be able to change what happened. 

Yet, we must come to terms with the fact that some things simply can’t be changed. We must understand that some things are in our control and some that aren’t. Say, if you regret getting a haircut, you’re in control. You can style it, cover it, or just wait for it to grow out again–you command your situation. But if you regret cursing out your boss before quitting your job, you’re not in control–you can’t take back your words.

The past is done. We can’t linger in our insecurities. We can’t ponder over our regrets. We must learn that what happened is out of our control now–we must let go. 

“Letting go is a necessary, if sometimes heart-wrenching gateway to genuine transformation,” is how the always-zen basketball coach Phil Jackson put it. They called it the “art of acquiescence”—the giving up and the assenting of whatever things are so that they can be what they are to become.

In one way, regret is just wishing things went the way we wanted them to. But by letting things become what they must, we are less likely to regret what we’ve done. In accepting that some things are simply out of our control, we are less likely to wish for a different outcome.

The past is something we can’t control anymore. We can’t change what we said, what we did, or how we felt. 

We can, however, control the present. We control how we grow from our experiences. We control how we respond to adversity. We control how we can use our regret to our advantage.

We control how we act right now. We must.

To learn more on this topic, check out “You Control How You Play”, where Ryan speaks to the Cleveland Browns about the importance of perspective, staying motivated, and knowing what they control. 

Love Your Fate

After we sort out what we control, we must find how to respond–regardless if we control what’s happening or not. We must determine how we handle ourselves. We must determine how we overcome obstacles. We must determine how to move forward.

In the first book of his Discourses, he envisions himself being executed by Roman guards, his life out of his control. In a display of tranquility and wisdom, he lays out his thoughts: 

“I must die. But must I die bawling? I must be put in chains–but moaning and groaning too? I must be exiled; but is there anything to keep me from going with a smile, calm and self-composed.”

Though the term was first coined by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, the practice of amor fati–loving your fate–dates back to he and them. Often by means of reflection and meditation, they would use this practice to settle past trauma and help them achieve a greater sense of inner peace. “The Fates guide the person who accepts them,” Cleanthes said, “and hinder the person who resists them.”

Amor fati is more than just understanding what happens to us. It’s understanding that our perception doesn’t always have to be negative. It’s understanding that accepting the present circumstances will make us better. It’s understanding that we must be grateful for the cloudy weather sometimes–and that there’s always a way through the storm.

We all face hardships. We all get stuck in traffic. We all deal with slow WiFi, or bad cell service, right when we need to send that important message. As rational people, we tend to think that these hardships were made specifically for us. That the world is out to get us. That we can’t win. 

But this couldn’t be farther from the truth. Everybody goes through obstacles. Everybody gets tripped up sometimes. As we talked about in the first section, we can’t control some things in life. And these hardships, no matter how hard we try, will always be out of our control.

When we accept what happens to us, after understanding that certain things— particularly bad things—are outside our control, we are left with this: loving whatever happens to us and facing it with unfailing cheerfulness and strength. As bestselling author Robert Greene (48 Laws of Power, Mastery) put it, we need to, “accept the fact that all events occur for a reason, and that it is within your capacity to see this reason as positive.”

Why get tripped up by the thorns? Why ponder over the sawdust on your floor? It’s simply part of nature! As long as you have the capability to see them, you have the capability to move past them.

In practicing amor fati, we’re also less likely to have regrets in the future. By embracing the challenges that lay ahead of us, we’re less likely to regret the decisions we make to conquer them – regardless of the outcome. We’re able to tackle the future with confidence, conviction, courage, and so much more. 

Amor fati is more than just a mindset–it’s a way of life. Incorporating amor fati into your life will take time, effort, and sacrifices that probably won’t feel comfortable. But we must. We must move past this existential angst. We must move forward, away from our regret, and towards our future. 

Love what’s happened to you. Love who you’ve become, and how much you’ve changed. Love your fate–amor fati.

Carry this reminder with you every day with our amor fati medallion from the store. Carry this in your pocket as a reminder to treat each and every moment–no matter how challenging–as something to be embraced, not avoided.

Look Ahead

Before Ryan Holiday gets on stage for a big speech, he runs through everything that could go wrong: trouble with the microphone, the clicker not advancing a slide, the audience not reacting as anticipated. He is able to see potential problems before they arise, and come up with solutions before anything actually happens. He is able to prevent himself from being overwhelmed if a problem arises by being prepared. 

“Rehearse them in your mind: exile, torture, war, shipwreck,” he said. “All the terms of our human lot should be before our eyes.”

This practice, called premeditatio malorum, is one of the oldest and most common practices in philosophy. It literally means the “premeditation of evils.” They used this practice to help them prepare for life’s inevitable hardships, and remain calm and confident in turbulent times.

The world isn’t fair. We all know this. We don’t always get what is ours, even if we’ve earned it. We don’t always win, even if we play hard. 

But we can’t be surprised when we don’t win. If it comes as a constant surprise each and every time something unexpected occurs, you’re not only going to be miserable whenever you attempt something big, you’re going to have a much harder time accepting it and moving on to attempts two, three, and four. You’re going to have a much harder time living in the present instead of lingering in the past. You’re going to have a much harder time trusting your instincts–and fighting regret.

There’s perhaps no better personification of premeditatio malorum than the great Booker T. Washington. Washington ran a school with 1,500 students, all while advising politicians and activists and traveling across the country to give speeches. But how? How did he maintain this lifestyle, and with such striking success?

“When I begin my work in the morning, I expect to have a successful and pleasant day of it, but at the same time I prepare myself to hear that one of our school buildings is on fire, or has burned, or that some disagreeable accident had occurred, or that someone has abused me in a public address or a printed article, for something that I have done or omitted to do, or or something that he had heard that I had said—probably something I had never thought of saying.”

He envisioned the worst possible things that could happen to him throughout his day. Not only envisioned, but he expected them to happen. In doing this, Washington was more prepared for the hardships of the day. A canceled train couldn’t be as bad as his school burning down. Being late to dinner couldn’t be as bad as someone verbally abusing him in public.

In preparing himself for challenges, Washington was simultaneously preparing himself for regret. Since he saw his fears right in front of him, and anticipated them happening, he was less scared of the outcomes of his choices–and he was less likely to regret them.

Practicing premeditatio malorum allows us to be more prepared for life’s inevitable setbacks. Though it may be hard to admit, everything will not go our way. We might not get that job that we want. We might not win that game. But we will be ready for any obstacles that cross our path. 

We’ll know that we made the right decision – and we won’t regret our choices.
