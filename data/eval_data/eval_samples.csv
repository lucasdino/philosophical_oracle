"Wisdom, ethical conduct, and mental development. Present moment awareness/mindfulness/concentrative practices fall within the domain of mental development. Mental development points itself toward wisdom, or the insights that liberate the mind from delusion and end suffering. Ethical conduct protects and reinforces the whole structure and keeps one on the path toward enlightenment. Our nature is not to exercise sense restraint and investigate things it's usually to run toward one thing and away from another constantly.",buddhism
"Mindfulness and meditation is part of it, but there is also moral training, cosmology and tradition. You can look at the eightfold path and see what the main factors are, meditation and mindfulness pertains to three of them, so there is quite a lot more than that. I personally would not want to associate it too much with the western mindfulness movement, their goal is to be stress free and relaxed, for us the goal is more ambitious. The goal is to tame the mind completely, to master it fully, and by doing so reach a state beyond life and death.",buddhism
"Do no harm, do all the good you can, and purify your mind",buddhism
"You must lead a good life. And a good life does not mean just good food, good clothes, good shelter. These are not sufficient. A good motivation is what is needed: compassion, without dogmatism, without complicated philosophy; just understanding that others are human brothers and sisters and respecting their rights and human dignity",buddhism
"Practice is really a 24/7/365 endeavor. There is no difference between our formal sessions and our work or our other obligations. That is the case because we always have our mind. What is it doing? Are we stuck in some bad thoughts or images emotions? If so, how do we get out of that? What is the situation in the moment teaching us? Dharma is written all over every experience.",buddhism
"The goal is not an escape from daily life but rather a deep awakening to the inherent beauty and interconnectedness of all things. It is a realization that the ordinary, seemingly mundane tasks are imbued with profound significance and can be approached with a sense of mindfulness, presence, and compassion.",buddhism
Keep the five precepts: Don’t kill any sentient being. Don’t steal. Don’t commit sexual misconduct. Don’t lie. Don’t consume alcohol or other intoxicants or drugs,buddhism
"In general, just go through life with compassion, empathy and being mindful (which is probably the most important thing).",buddhism
"I said life is like a blank piece of paper—it has no meaning until you sketch, paint, and add color to it.

Sounds a bit pretentious coming from someone who wasn’t even old enough to apply for a driving license, right? Still, corny or not, it was what I believed.

Seven years later, I still don’t have a driving license, and I still don’t think there’s a god or any inherent meaning to life. The blank paper analogy still holds.

But there’s been a shift. Lately, I’ve been struggling with my blank paper. I’m no longer sure if the picture I’m painting is the one I want. If I’m the one creating the meaning for my life, wouldn’t I always be aware of how artificial it is?

It feels like an enormous responsibility to create all your values by yourself. To be fully committed to anything in life requires an unwavering belief that it’s worth the effort. But if you know there’s no inherent meaning to it—that your pursuit is arbitrary—existential dread creeps in. That thought has left me stuck in a bind.",absurdism
"The other day, I was discussing this dilemma with a friend. After an hour-long conversation, we landed on a conclusion that, for now, feels like a good answer: You don’t have to commit to a single meaning. Go out. Explore. See what you like. Experiment. If the meaning you choose turns out to be garbage, throw it out the window.

There’s no perfect life, no singular “right” answer. Obsessing over the meaning of life without actually living it is counterproductive.

Start small. Take a leap of faith. Decide on a meaning—not for the rest of your life, just for now.

Take it one day at a time. Imagine your perfect day. What are the elements that make it fulfilling? Pick those elements, engage with them, live them. If you can go to bed satisfied at the end of the day, you’re on the right track.",absurdism
"He therefore concluded that discourse about meaning is a waste of time, and that the proper role of philosophy is to uncover what makes life worth living. What fulfills you? What makes you want to get out of bed in the morning? What makes you feel like you are thriving? Regardless of whether you believe life has meaning or not, you still have to decide whether you want to keep doing life or not; and as long as you've decided to keep doing life, you might as well do it right.",absurdism
"Life arranges a wedding for a hundred-year-old and a funeral for a newborn on the same day. Don't talk to me about meaning. Actually, be free to do it. It's meaningless anyway.",absurdism
When you realize nothing matters; everything matters.,absurdism
"If you mean that once you accept nothing matters you can experience everything else with the freedom of creating your own meaning and living in the moment, then yes, this absolutely resonates with me


",absurdism
Furthermore they can use the issue of falsifiability to back up their position which is similar to an agnostic position. Also they can still pursue deeper questions about existence but not hold out hope to having those questions answered. And any small hope they hold out has to be grounded into a type of pragmatism.,absurdism
"I wanted to share a few thoughts and open a discussion:

What defines identity? Are we shaped by our actions, memories, or something intrinsic? If our memories influence our identity, does it matter whether they’re authentic or fabricated?

The nature of love and connection: If a relationship feels real to the people involved, does it matter if it’s built on artificial or imperfect foundations? Can love still be meaningful if it’s driven by external factors rather than inherent choice?

Finding purpose in a vast universe: Does meaning come from being inherently ""special,"" or is it created through the choices we make and the lives we live? How do we reconcile the desire for significance with the possibility of being just one among many?

Reality versus perception: If something artificial or imagined provides comfort and meaning, does that make it less “real”? Where do we draw the line between what’s authentic and what’s not, and does that line even matter?

I find these questions both unsettling and fascinating because they touch on what it means to exist in an increasingly complex and disconnected world. What are your thoughts on these themes? Have you come across similar ideas in your own life, through art, or in philosophical discussions?",existentialism
"Even these concepts resist being reduced to practices because it insists on the primacy of individual experience—your practice, if you create one, must be your own.

This absence of prescription may feel unsettling, especially for those who have studied philosophies that offer clear, actionable steps. But its refusal to dictate a single path is not a weakness; rather, it is a profound recognition of the uniqueness of each human being and the singularity of our circumstances.",existentialism
"Through journaling, I do more than recount events or vent emotions (though I do that as well). I examine the philosophical underpinnings of my decisions and values. I actually type out, longhand, how my day went (in brief) and my thoughts about it. It's rarely more than 2 paragraphs, but it makes me focus on my day and gives me a context in which I will engage with tomorrow. I interrogate and delineate the anxieties that arise from my own freedom, the absurdity I encounter in daily life (like my job), and the meaning I attempt to create despite life’s inherent uncertainty. I actually go into my life's events for that day, what I did relative to what I had planned to do and in some cases, why I am not planning at all. It's rather wrapped up in a gratitude journal, where I try to remind myself what I am thankful for as a way to manage anxiety and rumination.",existentialism
"What am I doing to live authentically today? What fears am I avoiding, and how might confronting them deepen my understanding of my own existence? These exercises do not offer answers so much as they sharpen my awareness of the choices available to me and the weight of those choices.",existentialism
"To suggest some practical avenues: Engage in daily reflection, regularly revisit the texts, incorporate moments of mindfulness—not in the Zen sense of transcendence, but in the context of fully inhabiting and engaging with your freedom and responsibility to yourself and to your commitments. I'd also actively confront realities such as death, absurdity, and isolation head-on. Write or think deeply about these topics, not to resolve them but to better understand their role in shaping your life.",existentialism
"It is the widely celebrated philosophical idea of embracing nature and opposing materialism. Many believed that one could find their spirituality in themselves and through nature, and humans had an inherently good nature but the pitfalls of society and its systems corrupted them. They were considered some of the first environmentalists.",transcendentalism
"It is so focused on personal advancement and obtaining more things, a better job, or a better house. Many still choose to reject this construct— anyone who gets out in nature, a hiker or rock climber perhaps. The surfer, however, has a special itch to get back out to the ocean. Surfing has provided a rebirth of this living. It forces men and women to follow their inner self, reject society’s systems and chase waves.",transcendentalism
"It means somewhat the same thing as Idealism (Platonic Idealism), which holds that (1) there are Eternal Verities like Truth, Beauty and Goodness which are more real than material things, and (2) the human soul is immortal and has a fundamental affinity with these Eternal Verities.",transcendentalism
"A core belief is in the inherent goodness of people and nature, and while society and its institutions have corrupted the purity of the individual, people are at their best when truly ""self-reliant"" and independent.",transcendentalism
"not all pleasures were worth getting. If a pleasure requires a lot of pain to reach, or gives pain in the long run, then it is foolish to go for it. On the other hand not all pains are to be avoided if they give pleasure in the long run",epicureanism
our focus should be in filling those desires which are natural and necessary. We cannot avoid eating if we wish to live so we should take pleasure in simple fare that removes the pain of hunger. If you take pleasure in just removing the pain of hunger then you will not be disappointed when you don’t receive a three Michelin star meal.,epicureanism
"All pleasures are good, but some are far more trouble than they are worth",epicureanism
"We are often forced to choose between pleasure now/pain later, or the opposite, pain now, but pleasure later. We can try to fully enjoy the pleasure of the present, ""because tomorrow we die!"", but the cost may be a lifetime of poverty. The reverse also applies. The pain of getting a degree and student loan, can result in the lifetime pleasure of a satisfying career. Or of course, it may also result in even more misery: not worth it at all! It is so hard to be sure",epicureanism
"In terms of its applicability in everyday choices, I believe we are often applying hedonic calculus subconsciously, and so it's not a far reach to say we could all take a bit more time to consciously apply it to our everyday decisions; a problem then occurs when we must consciously choose pain to achieve an overall greater pleasure. It isn't enough to just know what the better decision is, for at this point it is a pious hope. If coupled with willpower or discipline, that is the will to face and embrace pain first and foremost, it then becomes a useful tool.",epicureanism
"Use, do not abuse…neither abstinence nor excess ever renders man happy",epicureanism
Pleasure is not a problem. Dopamine is not a problem. Too much pleasure experienced too often without a prior requirement for effort in order to achieve that pleasure/dopamine is terrible for us however. It lowers our baseline level of dopamine & the potency of all experiences.,epicureanism
"All of us, having evolved within a world of reliable cause and effect, take reliable causation for granted. All of our human concepts, including freedom and free will, subsume a world of reliable cause and effect, because they too evolved within that world.

Free will is not an illusion. It is just that philosophy has managed to screw-up its definition. Operationally, free will is when a person decides what they WILL do, FREE of coercion and undue influence (mental illness, hypnosis, etc.). That is the definition used to determine both moral and legal responsibility.",rationalism
"I don’t dwell on blame or randomness; instead, I ask what underlying causes—whether social, biological, or systemic—led us here. It's not fatalistic, but more like recognizing the chain of events that make reality what it is. For example, when I think about climate change, I see it not as an ""evil"" force but as the natural result of human behaviors embedded in larger economic and ecological systems.",rationalism
"everything has a reason, even if we don’t fully understand it, pushes me to approach life with curiosity and optimism. For instance, in modern science and technology, I see echoes of his pre-established harmony.",rationalism
"Combining both, I live with a sort of ""deterministic optimism."" The world operates according to principles we can understand, and while everything happens for a reason, we also have the capacity to influence what comes next.",rationalism
