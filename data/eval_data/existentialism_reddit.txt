Here is a path I have gone down, one that helps me.
Life, in a very true way, is perception. If I don't exist, I don't perceive. If I don't perceive time,
time can't exist. It all condenses or stretches into a single "thing" of non existence. If I don't
perceive the world around me, like literally in any fashion, it can't actually exist. To me, this
appears to be true. If there is no way, no senses, to perceive and experience – to the viewer, in
factual reality, nothing exists and time doesn't move on or even begin.
As I explored my fear of oblivion and non existence, I learned that much of it related to the
thought of loss. Loss of existing. Loss of memories. Loss of my personality. Loss of my place.
You're right, having lived – it makes death very different than not having been born. At least
from a perspective point of view. Death is losing everything that exists, if you view it as loss.
However, if I die and time breaks down for me. If it ceases to exist. So does everything, and
nothing. In a weird way, nothing ever exists or has existed in that point of view. If there was time
before I was born, time where I lived, and time after my death – it all loses any manifestation
once the perception of time and space cease.
So, nothing existed once I die. It's not a loss of myself, and of the world around me, etc. It will
have never been a thing. It never HAS been a thing. Nothing is lost because nothing was created.
(Its weird to think about because, of course, right now things DO exist and have always existed.
However, when a person dies I see it as two things being completely true; One, the world
continues to exist for others – In the perspective of the other, you have existed and you have
died, and the world will remain a fact. And also, at the same time, from the dead's point of view
– or lack there of – nothing ever existed and nothing was lost. Two states of reality / lack of
reality are factual. It only exists because it is perceived. Interestingly, and separately might I add,
I found that this actually lines up with our current understanding of quantum physics in certain
ways)
–––––––––––
Branching off of the previous path I had gone down, another came up for me.
If life is perceiving, existing – then that means there IS SOMETHING. This may be weird to
point out, but I bring it up because of a thought process. Have you ever considered why there is
something, rather than nothing? Like, I'm typing this on my computer, which is made up of stuff
that exists in something called space. And I perceive that. In our current understanding of the
universe, it tends to roll towards entropy and wanting for things to cease. So why does something
exist, rather than nothing? It's just weird right? We DO experience, rather than NOT-us NOTperceiving NOthing.
So, considering SOMETHING does EXIST. That means that NOTHING DOESN'T. That isn't
saying that nothing isn't real. That is saying that nothing doesn't exist – as that is the fact and
state of "nothing."
So, just perhaps, considering that something exists rather than nothing not existing, perception
after death MAY continue. I'm considering this from a logical point of view. Not to say that it is
guaranteed or even fully scientic to think so. However, considering something DOES exist,
something IS perceived, can it end? Can something not exist considering nothing doesn't exist as
well?
If perception is a fact of, well, whatever this all is – then perception would just somehow
continue being a fact. Maybe memories don't carry, maybe personality doesn't carry, maybe
nothing carries but perception. However, looking at it from that possibility (and to me it feels
fairly logical, though not denite, to look at it like so), death isn't the end of this whole thing.
This isn't meant to be spiritual. Maybe perception is all there is, and so therefore it doesn't end.
Whether that means something else somehow exists for this perception after human death, or that
all of perception feels as though it continues due to time breaking down in a way where the end
of time is not a thing for it – I don't know.
That could in a weird way be considered an afterlife, if perception continues while time also
continues.
–––––––––––
I want to get cemented in this, as what I see as, logical reasoning before I believe in a spiritual
afterlife. If I believe in one, I want it to be true to my understanding. I don't want to use the idea
of an afterlife as a support or way to ease fear – though I don't at all knock anyone else for doing
so. Maybe I'll believe in one in the future. I did in the past. But I want it to be from true faith, not
from fear.
