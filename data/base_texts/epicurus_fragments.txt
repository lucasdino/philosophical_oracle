Symposium

5) Polyaenus: "Do you, Epicurus, deny the existence of the warmth produced
by wine?" Someone interrupted: "It does not appear that wine is
unconditionally productive of heat." (And a little later:) "It seems that wine is
unconditionally productive of heat, but wine of a certain quantity might be
said to produce heat in a certain body."
6) Therefore we must not speak of wine as unconditionally productive of heat,
but rather say that a certain quantity of wine will produce heat in a certain
body which is in a certain disposition, or that a different quantity will produce
cold in a different body. For in the compound body of wine there are certain
particles out of which could might be produced, if, as need arises, united with
different particles they could form a structure which could cause cold. So that
those are deceived who say that wine is unconditionally heating or cooling.
7) Wine often enters the body without exerting any power either of heating or
of cooling, but when the structure is disturbed and an atomic rearrangement
takes place, the atoms which create heat at one time come together and by
their number give heat and inflammation to the body, at anther they retire and
so cool it.
8) Sexual intercourse has never benefited a man, and he is lucky if it has not
harmed him.
9) It is strange indeed that you were not at all impeded by your youth, as you
would say yourself, from attaining, young as you were, a distinction in the art
of rhetoric far above all you contemporaries, even the experienced an famous.
It is strange indeed, I say, that you were not at all impeded by your youth from
winning distinction in the art of rhetoric, which seems to require much
practice and habituation, whereas youth can be an impediment to the
understanding of the true nature of the world, towards which knowledge
might seem to contribute more than practice and habituation.

10) I do not know how I can conceive the good, if I withdraw the pleasures of

54) Vain is the word of a philosopher which does not heal any suffering of

about what concerns the noblest and holiest of beings. Further, let us be free
of any care in regard to their opinion. Thus, one may live in conformity with
nature...
58) If the gods listened to the prayers of men, all men would quickly have
perished: for they are always praying for evil against one another.

***
Ethics

59) The beginning and the root of all good is the pleasure of the stomach;
even wisdom and culture must be referred to this.
60) We have need of pleasure when we suffer pain because of pleasure's
absence; but when we are not feeling such pain, though we are in a condition
of sensation, we have no need of pleasure. For the pleasure which arises from
nature does not produce wickedness, but rather the longing connected with
vain fancies.
61) That which creates insuperable joy is the complete removal of a great evil.
And this is the nature of good, if one can once grasp it rightly and then hold
by it, rather than walking about tediously babbling about the good.2
62) It is better to endure particular pains which produce greater satisfactions
that we may enjoy. It is well to abstain from particular pleasures which
produce more severe pains so that we may not suffer them.
63) Let us not blame the flesh as the cause of great evils, nor blame fate for
our distresses.
64) Great pains will quickly put an end to life; but chronic pains are not severe.
65. Excessive pain will send you to death.
66) Through love of true philosophy, every troublesome and disturbing desire
is ended.
67) Thanks be to blessed Nature because she has made what is necessary easy
to supply, and what is not easy unnecessary.
68) It is common to find a man poor in determining the natural end of life but
rich with empty fancies. For no fool is satisfied with what he has, but is
distressed for what he has not. Just as men with a fever, through the
malignancy of their disease, are always thirsty and desire the most injurious
things, so too those whose mind is in an evil state are always poor in
everything and in their greed are plunged into capricious desires.
69) Nothing satisfies the man who is not satisfied with a little.
70) Self-sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth.
71) Most men fear frugality and through their fear are led to actions most
likely to produce fear.
72) Many men when they have acquired riches have not found the escape from
their ills but have only exchanged them for greater ills.
73) By means of occupations worthy of a beast, abundance of riches is heaped
up, but a miserable life results.
74) Unhappiness comes either through fear or through vain and unbridled
desire: but if a man curbs these, he can win for himself the blessedness of
wisdom.
75) It is not deprivation of these things which is the source of pain; such
unnecessary suffering arises from vain fancies.
76) The crude soul is puffed up by prosperity and cast down by misfortune.
77) Nature teaches us to pay little heed to what fortune brings, and when we
are prosperous to understand that we are unfortunate, and when we are
unfortunate not to regard prosperity highly, and to receive unemotionally the
good things which come from fortune and to range ourselves boldly against
the seeming evils which it brings: for all that the many regard as good or evil is
fleeting, and wisdom has nothing in common with fortune.
78) He who least needs tomorrow will most gladly greet tomorrow.
79) I spit upon the beautiful and those who vainly admire it, when it does not
produce any pleasure.
80) The greatest fruit of justice is peace of mind.
81) Laws are made for the sake of the wise, not to prevent them from
inflicting wrong but to secure them from suffering it.
82) Even if they [wrongdoers] are able to escape punishment, it is impossible
to win security by escaping: and so the fear of the future which always presses
upon them does not suffer them to be happy or to be free from anxiety in the
present.
83) The man who has attained the natural end of the human race will be
equally good, even when no one else is present.
84) A man who causes fear cannot be free from fear.
85. Happiness and blessedness do not correlate with abundance of riches,
exalted positions, or offices or power, but with freedom from pain and
gentleness of feeling and a state of mind that sets limits that are in accordance
with nature.
86) Live in anonymity. [Lathe biosas.]
87) We must say how best a man will maintain the natural end of life, and how
one will not willingly at first pursue public office.

It is strange indeed, I say, that you were not at all impeded by your youth from

3) Prophecy does not exist, and even if it did exist, things that come to pass
must be counted nothing to us.
***
Against Theophrastus

4) But even apart form this argument I do not know how one should say that
things in the dark have color.1
***
Symposium

5) Polyaenus: "Do you, Epicurus, deny the existence of the warmth produced
by wine?" Someone interrupted: "It does not appear that wine is
unconditionally productive of heat." (And a little later:) "It seems that wine is
unconditionally productive of heat, but wine of a certain quantity might be
said to produce heat in a certain body."
6) Therefore we must not speak of wine as unconditionally productive of heat,
but rather say that a certain quantity of wine will produce heat in a certain
body which is in a certain disposition, or that a different quantity will produce
cold in a different body. For in the compound body of wine there are certain
particles out of which could might be produced, if, as need arises, united with
different particles they could form a structure which could cause cold. So that
those are deceived who say that wine is unconditionally heating or cooling.
7) Wine often enters the body without exerting any power either of heating or
of cooling, but when the structure is disturbed and an atomic rearrangement
takes place, the atoms which create heat at one time come together and by
their number give heat and inflammation to the body, at anther they retire and
so cool it.
8) Sexual intercourse has never benefited a man, and he is lucky if it has not
harmed him.
9) It is strange indeed that you were not at all impeded by your youth, as you
would say yourself, from attaining, young as you were, a distinction in the art
of rhetoric far above all you contemporaries, even the experienced an famous.
It is strange indeed, I say, that you were not at all impeded by your youth from
winning distinction in the art of rhetoric, which seems to require much
practice and habituation, whereas youth can be an impediment to the
understanding of the true nature of the world, towards which knowledge
might seem to contribute more than practice and habituation.

On the Goal of Life

10) I do not know how I can conceive the good, if I withdraw the pleasures of
taste, withdraw the pleasures of love, withdraw the pleasures of hearing, and
withdraw the pleasurable emotions caused by the sight of a beautiful form.

11) The stable condition of well-being in the body and the sure hope of its
continuance holds the fullest and surest joy for those who can rightly calculate
it.
12) Beauty and virtue and the like are to be honored, if they give pleasure; but
if they do not give pleasure, we must bid them farewell.

On Nature
Book I

13) The nature of the universe consists of bodies and void.
14) The nature of all existing things is bodies and space.
Book XI

15) For if it [the sun] had lost its size through the distance, much more would
it have lost its color: for there is no other distance better adapted for such loss
than that of the sun.

***
From Uncertain Works

16) The atom is a hard body free from any admixture of void; the void is
intangible existence.
17) Away with them all: for he [Nausiphanes], like many another slave, exerted
himself with that sophistic boasting.
Remains of Letters

18) If they have this in mind, they are victorious over the evils of want and
poverty.
19) Even if war comes, he would not count it terrible, if the gods are
propitious. He has led and will lead a pure life in Matro’s company, by favor of
the gods.
20) Tell me, Polyaenus, do you know what has been a great joy to us?

***
Letters to Several Persons
To the Philosophers in Mytilene

21) This drove him [Nausiphanes] to such a state of fury that he abused me
and ironically called me Master.
22) I suppose that those grumblers will believe me to be a disciple of The
Mollusk [Nausiphanes] and to have listened to his teaching in company with a
few hard-drinking youths. For indeed the fellow was a bad man and his habits,
as such, could never lead to wisdom.
***
Letters to Individuals
To Anaxarchus

23) I summon you to continuous pleasures and not to vain and empty virtues
which have but a desperate hope for rewards.
***
To Apelles

24) I congratulate you, Apelles, in that you have approached philosophy free
from all corruption.

***
To Themista

25) If you two don’t come to me, I am capable of being persuade to rush on
my own to wherever you and Themista summon me.
***
To Idomenus

26) Send us therefore offerings for the sustenance of your sacred body on
behalf of yourself and your children: this is how it occurs to me to put it.
27) Oh thou, who from youth has regarded all my prompting as sweet.
28) If you wish to make Pythocles rich, do not give him more money, but
diminish his desire.
29) We think highly of frugality not that we may always keep to a cheap and
simple diet, but as a means to keep us free from hunger.
30) On this truly happy day of my life, while at the point of death, I write this
to you. The disease in my bladder and stomach are pursuing their course,
lacking nothing of their natural severity: but against all this is the joy in my
heart at the recollection of my conversations with you. Do you, as I might
expect form your devotion from boy hood to me and to philosophy, take good
care of the children of Metrodorus.
***
To Colotes

31) In your feeling of reverence for what I was then saying you were seized
with an unaccountable desire to embrace me and clasp my knees and show me
all the signs of homage paid by men in prayers and supplications to others; so
you made me return all these proofs of veneration and respect to you. Go on
thy way as immortal and think of us too as immortal.
***
To Leontion (aka Leontium)

32) Lord and Savior, my dearest Leontion, what a hurrahing you drew from us,
when we read aloud your dear letter.
***
To Pythocles

33) Launch your boat, oh blessed youth, and flee at full speed from every form
of culture.
34) I shall sit down and await your lovely and godlike appearance.

Letters to Uncertain Persons
To a Boy or Girl

35) We have arrived at Lampsacus safe and sound—Pythocles, Hermarchus,
Ctesippus and I—and there we found Themista and our other friends all well.
I hope you too are well and your mamma, and that you are always obedient to
Papa and Matro, as you used to be. Let me tell you that the reason that I and
all the rest of us love you is that you are always obedient to them.

Letter Written in His Last Days

36) A week before writing this, the stoppage became complete and I suffered
pains such as bring men to their last day. If anything happens to me, do you
look after the children of Metrodorus for four or five years, but do not sped
any more on them than you now spend each year on me.

Letters Written to Unknown Recipients

37) I am thrilled with pleasure in the body, when I live on bread and water,
and I spit upon luxurious pleasures not for their own sake, but because of the
inconveniences that follow them.
38) As I told you when you were going away, take care also of his brother
Apollodorus. He is not a bad boy, but causes me anxiety, when he does what
he does not mean to do.
39) Send me a pot of cheese, so that I may have a feast when I care to.
40) You have looked after me wonderfully generously in sending me food, and
have given proofs heaven-high of your good will to me.
41) The only contribution I require is that which ... ordered the disciples to
send me, even if they are among the Hyperboreans. I wish to receive from
each of you two hundred and twenty drachmae a year and no more.
42) He shall realize a valuable return in the instruction which I have given him.
43) I never desired to please the rabble. What pleased them, I did not learn;
and what I knew was far removed from their understanding.
44) Do not think it unnatural that when the flesh cries out, the soul cries too.
The flesh cries out to be saved from hunger, thirst, and cold. It is hard for the
soul to repress these cries, and dangerous for it to disregard nature’s summons,
because the soul accustomed to independence day by day.
45) The man who follows nature and not groundless opinions is independent
of all things. For in reference to what is enough for nature, every possession is
riches—but in reference to unlimited desires, even the greatest wealth [is not
riches but poverty].
46) Your anxiety is directly proportional to your forgetfulness of nature, for
you bring on yourself unlimited fears and desires.
47) We have been born once and there can be no second birth. For all eternity
we shall no longer be. But you, although you are not master of tomorrow, are
postponing your happiness. We waste away our lives in delaying, and each of
us dies without having enjoyed leisure. (Vatican saying XIV)
48) It is better for you to be free of fear lying upon a bed of straw, than to
have a golden couch and a lavish table and be full of trouble.
49) ... remembering your letter and your discussion about the men who are
not able to see the analogy between phenomena and the unseen nor the
harmony which exists between sensations and the unseen and again the
contradiction...
50. Sweet is the memory of a deceased friend.
51) Do not avoid conferring small favors: for then you will likewise seem to be
open to conferring great things.
52) If your enemy makes a request to you, do not scorn his request; but keep
on your guard; for he is like a dog.
53) It is not the pretended but the real pursuit of philosophy that is needed;
for we do not need the appearance of good health but to enjoy it in truth.
(Vatican saying 54)

Fragments from Uncertain Sources
On Philosophy

54) Vain is the word of a philosopher which does not heal any suffering of
man. For just as there is no profit in medicine if it does not expel the diseases

of the body, so there is no profit in philosophy either, if it does not expel the
suffering of the mind.

***
Physics

55) Nothing new happens in the universe, as compared to the infinite span of
time that has already passed.
56) We shall not be considering them [the gods] any happier or less
destructible, if we think of them as neither speaking nor conversing with one
another, but resembling dumb men.
57) Let us at least offer pious and noble sacrifices where it is customary, and
let us do all things lawfully while not troubling ourselves with common beliefs
about what concerns the noblest and holiest of beings. Further, let us be free
of any care in regard to their opinion. Thus, one may live in conformity with
nature...
58) If the gods listened to the prayers of men, all men would quickly have
perished: for they are always praying for evil against one another.

***
Ethics

59) The beginning and the root of all good is the pleasure of the stomach;
even wisdom and culture must be referred to this.
60) We have need of pleasure when we suffer pain because of pleasure's
absence; but when we are not feeling such pain, though we are in a condition
of sensation, we have no need of pleasure. For the pleasure which arises from
nature does not produce wickedness, but rather the longing connected with
vain fancies.
61) That which creates insuperable joy is the complete removal of a great evil.
And this is the nature of good, if one can once grasp it rightly and then hold
by it, rather than walking about tediously babbling about the good.2
62) It is better to endure particular pains which produce greater satisfactions
that we may enjoy. It is well to abstain from particular pleasures which
produce more severe pains so that we may not suffer them.
63) Let us not blame the flesh as the cause of great evils, nor blame fate for
our distresses.
64) Great pains will quickly put an end to life; but chronic pains are not severe.
65. Excessive pain will send you to death.
66) Through love of true philosophy, every troublesome and disturbing desire
is ended.
67) Thanks be to blessed Nature because she has made what is necessary easy
to supply, and what is not easy unnecessary.
68) It is common to find a man poor in determining the natural end of life but
rich with empty fancies. For no fool is satisfied with what he has, but is
distressed for what he has not. Just as men with a fever, through the
malignancy of their disease, are always thirsty and desire the most injurious
things, so too those whose mind is in an evil state are always poor in
everything and in their greed are plunged into capricious desires.
69) Nothing satisfies the man who is not satisfied with a little.
70) Self-sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth.
71) Most men fear frugality and through their fear are led to actions most
likely to produce fear.
72) Many men when they have acquired riches have not found the escape from
their ills but have only exchanged them for greater ills.
73) By means of occupations worthy of a beast, abundance of riches is heaped
up, but a miserable life results.
74) Unhappiness comes either through fear or through vain and unbridled
desire: but if a man curbs these, he can win for himself the blessedness of
wisdom.
75) It is not deprivation of these things which is the source of pain; such
unnecessary suffering arises from vain fancies.
76) The crude soul is puffed up by prosperity and cast down by misfortune.
77) Nature teaches us to pay little heed to what fortune brings, and when we
are prosperous to understand that we are unfortunate, and when we are
unfortunate not to regard prosperity highly, and to receive unemotionally the
good things which come from fortune and to range ourselves boldly against
the seeming evils which it brings: for all that the many regard as good or evil is
fleeting, and wisdom has nothing in common with fortune.
78) He who least needs tomorrow will most gladly greet tomorrow.
79) I spit upon the beautiful and those who vainly admire it, when it does not
produce any pleasure.
80) The greatest fruit of justice is peace of mind.
81) Laws are made for the sake of the wise, not to prevent them from
inflicting wrong but to secure them from suffering it.
82) Even if they [wrongdoers] are able to escape punishment, it is impossible
to win security by escaping: and so the fear of the future which always presses
upon them does not suffer them to be happy or to be free from anxiety in the
present.
83) The man who has attained the natural end of the human race will be
equally good, even when no one else is present.
84) A man who causes fear cannot be free from fear.
85. Happiness and blessedness do not correlate with abundance of riches,
exalted positions, or offices or power, but with freedom from pain and
gentleness of feeling and a state of mind that sets limits that are in accordance
with nature.
86) Live in anonymity. [Lathe biosas.]
87) We must say how best a man will maintain the natural end of life, and how
one will not willingly at first pursue public office.
